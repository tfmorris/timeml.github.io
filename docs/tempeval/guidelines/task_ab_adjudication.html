Documents are not assigned  to a particular adjudicator.</p><p>Clicking on a document name brings up the document widow:</p><blockquote>  <p><img src="images/taskAB-adj3.jpg" width="743" height="510" border="3"></p></blockquote><p>Each event that needs to be linked is displayed on a separate line with its  sentence context. As with the dual annotation phase, a sentence is repeated  if there is more that one event in it. In fact, each event-timex pair from  task  A is displayed with its sentence and each event-DCT pair from task B is displayed  with its sentence. Sentences with pairs from task A have a bold-faced event  and a bold-faced time expression, sentences with pairs from task B only have  a bold-faced event, the Document Creation Time is listed in sentence   zero.</p><p>The right-hand-side lists the results of the dual annotation. For sentence  3, the string <font color="#FF0000">A:O:O</font> indicates that annotator one  selected A as the relation type and annotator two selected O. The third letter  indicates  the value that was in TimeBank, often this is the same as the choice of annotator  two. The seven possible values are:</p><ol>  <li>Before (B)</li>  <li>Overlap (O)</li>  <li>After (A)</li>  <li>Vague (V)</li>  <li>Before-Or-Overlap (BO)</li>  <li>Overlap-Or-After (OA)</li>  <li>Unknown (U, for TimeBank only)</li></ol><p>If two annotators disagree, then the string is displayed in red, as with sentence  3 above. For all these cases, the adjudicator should check one of the 6 radio  buttons on  the  right. The adjudicator is not expected to check all the cases where  the two annotators agreed, but is allowed to overrule the two annotators, even  if they agree.</p><p>At the bottom of the display (not visible in the screenshot above) are two  buttons: &quot;Submit Judgements&quot; and &quot;Document List&quot;. The first one submits  adjudication judgements. When the adjudicator clicks this button, all relation  type judgements on the right are added to the tally of approved links on  the document list. The first time the adjudicator does this, all links the  two annotators agreed on will be approved, so the tally can go up even if the  adjudicator did not select a single relation type.  The &quot;Document List&quot; button  links  back to the  list with all documents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
