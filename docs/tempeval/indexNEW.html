A restricted set of temporalrelations will be used, which includes only the relations: <tt>BEFORE</tt>,<tt>AFTER</tt>, and <tt>OVERLAP</tt> (defined to encompass all cases where event intervalshave non-empty overlap).</p><blockquote><table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width="80%"><tr><th width="15%" valign=top> TASK A: <td>For a restricted set of event terms, identify temporal relations    between events and all time expressions appearing in the same    sentence. <br> <i> (NOTE: The restricted set of event terms is to    be specified by providing a list of root forms.

Text comprehension, even at the most general level,involves the capability to identify the events described in a text andlocate these in time. This capablity is crucial to a wide range of NLPapplications, from document summarization and question answering tomachine translation. Furthermore, recent work on the annotation ofevent and temporal relations have resulted in both a de-facto standardfor expressing these relations (<ahref="http://www.timeml.org/">TimeML</a>) and a hand-built goldstandard of annotated texts (<ahref="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T08">TimeBank</a>). Thesehave already been used as the basis for automatic Time and Eventannotation tasks in a number of research projects in recent years.<p> As in many areas of NLP an open evaluation challenge in the area oftemporal annotation will serve to drive research forward. Theautomatic identification of all temporal referring expressions, eventsand temporal relations within a text is the ultimate aim of researchin this area. However, addressing this aim in a first evaluationchallenge is likely to be too difficult and a staged approach moreeffective. Thus we here propose an initial evaluation exercise basedon three limited tasks that we believe are realistic both from theperspective of assembling resources for development and testing andfrom the perspective of developing systems capable of addressing thetasks.<h4>Task Definitions</h4><p> Given a set of test texts (DataSet1) for which (1) sentence boundaries are annotated, (2) all temporal expressions are annotated in accordance with TIMEX3, (3) the document creation time (DCT) is specially annotated, and (4) a list of root forms of event identifying terms (the Event Target List or ETL) is supplied,complete the following tasks<ul><li><b>Task A:</b> For each event whose root form occurs in the ETL, linkthis event to time expressions in the same sentence as appropriateusing a restricted set of temporal relations<br><li><b>Task B:</b> For each event whose root form occurs in the ETL, linkthis event to the DCT as appropriate using a restricted set oftemporal relations<li><b> Task C:</b> For each contiguous pair of matrix verbs link theevents signalled by these verbs as appropriate using a restricted setof temporal relations. For task C a separate set of test texts(DataSet2) is supplied which is annotated as is DataSet1, and inaddition is annotated to identify the main verb in the matrix clause("matrix verb") of each sentence.</ul><p>Remarks:</p><ol><li> The restricted set of temporalrelations contains: <tt>BEFORE</tt>, <tt>AFTER</tt>, and <tt>OVERLAP</tt> (defined to encompassall cases where event intervals have non-empty overlap). In addition, we allow three disjunctive relations: <tt>BEFORE-OR-OVERLAP</tt>, <tt>OVERLAP-OR-AFTER</tt> and<tt>VAGUE</tt> (for completely underspecified relations). <li> By "as appropriate" here is meant as indicated in theTimeML standard. <li> For tasks A and B, in cases where there are multiple timeexpressions in the sentence, the event should be linked to all TIMEXswhere appropriate.<li> For the ETL we propose to use those terms whose variants in allinflected forms occur as events in TimeBank 20 times or more, whichyields a list of around 63 root forms whose variants are included.<li> Task C is the most ambitious of the three tasks proposed, onewhich we view as exploratory in nature. Given the challenges itpresents we would not expect all participants to attempt it.</ol><h4>Resources</h4><p> Participants will be supplied with a version of TimeBank (183documents, approx. 2500 sentences) which has had TimeML annotationsremoved or modified so they contain only the information to be suppliedin the test corpus plus the TLINK annotations to be found as part ofthe task definitions.<p> The test corpus will consist of a number of articles not currentlyincluded within TimeBank, which will be annotated in accordance withthe schemes outlined above. For tasks A and B, it is intended thatthis should include at least 5 occurrences for each item in theETL. For task C, we propose to annotate around 20-25 news articles(including of the order of 200-250 sentences) drawn from sourcessimilar to those used for TimeBank.<h4>Evaluation Methodology</h4>Tasks A, B and C can all be seen as classification tasks, where agiven temporal links is assigned a relation type from the set<tt>BEFORE</tt>, <tt>AFTER</tt>, <tt>OVERLAP</tt>, <tt>BEFORE-OR-OVERLAP</tt>, <tt>OVERLAP-OR-AFTER</tt> or<tt>VAGUE</tt>. Precision and recall over these relation types are used asevaluation metrics.<p><hr><table cellpadding=4><tr valign=middle>  <td><img src="logo-brandeis.jpg" alt="Brandeis University Logo" width="100" height="100">   <td><img src="logo-sheffield.gif" alt="University of Sheffield Logo" width="180" height="86">   <td><img src="logo-osnabruck.gif" alt="Universitaet Osnabrueck Logo" width="180" height="86">   <td><img src="logo-thomson.gif" alt="Thomson Legal and Regulatory Logo"> </table><hr> <i>Last modified October 13th, 2006</i><hr>  </tr></table></body></html>
