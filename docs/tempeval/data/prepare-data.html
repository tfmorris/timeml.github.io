Participation  will hopefully get TimeML, and the tools we have written for it, out there. We thought  this was a good idea in a moment of mental weakness. It is actually, but it  involves  more work than we bargained for.</p><p>For TempEval, we have defined three tasks:</p><blockquote><table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 width="80%"><tr><th width="15%" valign=top> TASK A: <td>For a restricted set of event terms, identify temporal relations    between events and all time expressions appearing in the same    sentence. The restricted set of events contains the 59 stems that occur 20    times or more.<tr><th valign=top> TASK B: <td>For the samerestricted set of event terms, identify temporal relations    between events and the Document Creation Time (DCT). <tr><th valign=top> TASK C: <td> Identify the temporal relations betweeen contiguous pairs of    main verbs. </table> </blockquote> <p>To reduce the complexity of the tasks, we adopted a restricted set of relation  types: BEFORE, AFTER, OVERLAP and NON-RELATED. We have a task home page at  <a href="http://timeml.org/tempeval/">http://timeml.org/tempeval/</a>.</p><p>Part of the deal is to provide    a dataset,    which    is    built uponTimeBank 1.2. Here are some relevant TimeBank statistics:</p><blockquote><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">  <tr>    <td>documents</td>    <td align="right">183</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>sentences</td>    <td align="right">1967</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>tlinks</td>    <td align="right">6418</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>tlinks after closure</td>    <td align="right">84882</td>  </tr></table></blockquote><p>The hope was that most links we needed were already in TimeBank. That turns out to be not the case:</p><blockquote><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">  <tr>    <td rowspan="2">&nbsp;</td>    <td rowspan="2">total</td>    <td colspan="2">in timebank</td>    <td rowspan="2">need to add</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>before closure</td>    <td>after closure</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Task A</td>    <td>1669</td>    <td align="right">508</td>    <td align="right">819</td>    <td align="right">850</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Task B</td>    <td>2733</td>    <td align="right">609</td>    <td align="right">1055</td>    <td align="right">1687</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Task C</td>    <td>1263</td>    <td align="right">?</td>    <td align="right">?</td>    <td align="right">?</td>  </tr></table></blockquote><p>As is clear in the table above, a fair amount of links need to be added. In fact, we even need to check all existing links because the quality of the TLINK tags is the main bottleneck in the current version of TimeBank and for an evaluation task we need to get the quality up.</p><p>So far, data preparation has gone though the following steps:</p><ol>  <li>Took all documents from TimeBank 1.2</li>  <li>Ran closure over all documents</li>  <li>Removed        all tags that were not needed for tasks A, B and C (includes all SIGNAL,      SLINK and ALINK tags as well as most TLINK tags).</li>  <li>Mapped all relation types onto the restricted set used for TempEval: BEFORE,    AFTER, OVERLAP, NON-RELATED.</li>  <li>Added all TLINK          tags that were needed for the tasks, but that were still missing, setting    the relation type to UNKNOWN.</li></ol><p>Some statistics on existing relation types:</p><blockquote><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">  <tr>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>BEFORE</td>    <td>AFTER</td>    <td>OVERLAP</td>    <td>NON-RELATED</td>    <td>UNKNOWN</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Task A</td>    <td align="right">46</td>    <td align="right">50</td>    <td align="right">723</td>    <td align="right">0</td>    <td align="right">850</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Task B</td>    <td align="right">668</td>    <td align="right">72</td>    <td align="right">315</td>    <td align="right">0</td>    <td align="right">1678</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>total</td>    <td align="right">714</td>    <td align="right">122</td>    <td align="right">1038</td>    <td align="right">0</td>    <td align="right">2528</td>  </tr></table></blockquote><p>Remaining tasks:</p><ol>  <li>Add 2528 links for tasks A and B, using dual annotation.</li>  <li>Check all 1874 existing links for task A and B</li>  <li>Add markup for main event</li>  <li>Check and add links for tasks C</li>  <li>Update Tango if needed</li>  <li>Write tool for task 3</li>  <li>Merge results, adjucate where needed</li>  <li>Write scoring scripts</li>  <li>Annotate test corpus</li></ol><p>We will use Tango for adding the tlinks (all tasks) and a special  tool for adding main event annotation.</p><h3>Action Items</h3><p>The immediate horizon is to prepare data sets fro tasks A and B. The task  distribution is as follows:</p><ol>  <li>Tool updates: Alex, Marc.    Tango chokes on OVERLAP (as it should). it needs to be adjusted to work with    the limited relation set. This involves    creating    new timeml schema and bundeling it into the Tango jar. Deadline: Monday October    23rd.</li>  <li>Alternative annotation tool: Marc. Tango is not particularly suited    for this task, provide one that is better and allows faster annotation. Monday    October 23rd.</li>  <li>Add tlinks for tasks A and B (dual annotation): Catherine,      Seo-Hyun, Anna, Hongyuan, Emin, Amber, Mike. The number of links per person      is just under a thousand, which, at an average speed of 5 links per minute,      translates    into 3 hours of highly exciting work. You will get    about 40 documents to annotate. Each document will have all links (about    25 on avergae already in there, but some of them have a relation type UNKNOWN    and    will show up in green. These need to be turned into one of the three allowed    relation types. Deadline is Friday October 27th.</li>  <li>Merge dual annotations and identify clashes: Marc: Deadline is Monday October    30th.</li>  <li>Resolve clashing tlinks for tasks A and B: Marc, Jess, Roser Deadline is    Friday November 3rd.</li>  <li>Remove MAKEINSTANCE from resulting document: Marc.</li></ol><p>Task distribution for task C is to be determined. The final task is to create  a test corpus, probably a selection of 20-25 documents from the Aquaint corpus.</p></body></html>
