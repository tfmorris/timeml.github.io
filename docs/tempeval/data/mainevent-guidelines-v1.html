Perhaps  quotes should have their own main events?). </p>  <p>g- For aspectual verbs, choosethe complement as a main event, not the aspectual. </p>  <blockquote>    <p>&quot;A new Essex        County task force [began] [delving] Thursday into the [slayings] of 14      black women over the last five years...&quot;</p>  </blockquote>  <p> 'Delving'  should be chosen as the main event, not 'began'.</p>  <p>h- For light verbs, choosethe complement</p>  <blockquote>    <p>&quot;To either [hold] on tight or [get] out, as much    of Asia [goes] into [recession].&quot; </p>  </blockquote>  <p>'Recession' should labeled as the      main event here,  because 'goes' doesn't have much weight on its own.</p><p>i- For causal sentences...</p>  <p>We (seoHyun and Amber) couldn't decide. If &quot; The [rains] [caused]    the [flooding]&quot;, [caused] is obviously not the main event, but we couldn't    decide whether the rains or the flooding should be the main event. This mightbe an arbitrary decision, or just a 'go with the first one' rule. </p></body></html>
