Workshop DescriptionThe computational analysis of time is a challenging and very topical problem, asthe needs of applications based on information extraction techniques expand toinclude varying degrees of time stamping and temporal ordering of events and/orrelations within a narrative.</center><BR><H4>Motivation and Aims</H4><P align="justify">The scope of this workshop is to bring together designers, developersand users of content encoding practices in order to promote <i>defacto</i> standards for  content creation, management anddelivery. More specifically, the workshop provides a hands-on meetingmeant to generate a manifesto of requirements and recommendations forbest practices in content interoperability. Such a manifesto isintended to form the basis for a business-driven alliance ofpractitioners and users from the industries and research organizationsin the area of attention, whose goal is to converge on a specificoperational metadata scheme for virtual integration in the  creation,management and delivery of content. <h4> Market Situation </h4><P align="justify">In the next five years, Human Language Technologies (HLT) related tocontent processing will find their steadiest and strongest growthwithin the market segments of Content Management and Syndication. Inthe US alone, Content Management software is expected to generaterevenues of nearly $5.2 billion by 2005 (Merrill Lynch, 6/01) and upto $7.2 billion by 2006 (Butler Group). Jupiter (5/01) estimates about70% of the archived content market --- $850 million in 2001 and -->--estimated to grow to $4.6 billion in 2006 --- will be realized -->--through syndication. The ensuing opportunities for language-based -->--solutions to content understanding, extraction and generation tasks -->--are therefore substantial.<h4> Virtual Integration </h4><P align="justify">The materialization of such prospected opportunities requires theavailability of content interoperability standards capable to grantHuman Language Technologies seamless integration in the contentcreation, management and delivery supply chain. Most current ContentManagement environments offer a relatively open softwareinfrastructure in which a variety of HLT components can beintegrated. However, the opportunity of operational integration intoContent Management infrastructures, whether implemented in OEM or ASPmode, will have a fragmentary effect on the HLT industry as a whole ifit continues to rely on proprietary metadata schemes. HLT solutionswill continue to be tightly knit into the specific applications theywere engineered to service and less adaptable to other systems, with aconsequent lack of fair competition for HLT providers and paucity ofchoice for prospective buyers. Open content interoperability standardsare thus necessary to stimulate market growth in the HLT sector andprovide a healthy competitive environment for the HLT industry as awhole.<h4> Semantic Web Standards</h4><P align="justify">Emerging Semantic Web standards such as DAML and OIL are now startingto provide a description framework in which complex meaningrelationships can be actively encoded and effectively engaged incategorization, search, navigation, retrieval and extractiontechnologies. However, Semantic Web standards must be tailored to thespecific needs of vertical industries in order to promote businessviability for the technologies they are intended to facilitate. Thisis demonstrated by the creation and use of metadata standards such asPRISM, NewsML, NITF and ICE in the publishing industry.  In addressingthe need for syndicating, aggregating, post-processing andmulti-purposing content, these initiatives have built consortia wherecontent providers and content management software vendors worktogether to create the "right" vocabulary and support in the leadingsoftware tools, facilitating widespread adoption throughout theindustry.<h4> Workshop Format</h4><P align="justify">The workshop comprises two working sessions. The morning session willconsist of 3 invited talks (35 minutes each including discussion),each followed by two short papers (20 minutes each includingdiscussion). The afternoon session will be devoted to an in-depthdiscussion of issues raised during the morning session with the aim ofconverging on a lockstep approach to the deliberation of contentinteroperability standards. </P>  The challenges derive from the combinedrequirements of a mapping process (text to a rich representation of temporalentities), representational framework (ontologically-grounded temporal graph),and reasoning capability (combining common-sense inference with temporalaxioms).Usually contextualized in question-answering applications (with obviousdependencies of answers on time), temporal awareness directly impacts numerousareas of NLP and AI: text summarization over events and their participants;making inferences from events in a text; overlaying timelines on documentcollections; commonsense reasoning in narrative and story understanding.Interest in temporal analysis and event-based reasoning has spawned a number ofimportant meetings, particularly as applied to IE and QA tasks (cf. at COLING2000; ACL 2001; LREC 2002; TERQAS 2002; TANGO 2003, Dagstuhl 2005).<table border=2 bgcolor=#FFFFFF> <tr>  <td>8:45-09:00</td> <td>Opening</td></tr> <tr>  <td>09:00-09:35</td> <td>Invited talk I</td></tr> <tr>  <td>09:35-10:15</td> <td>Two Short Papers</td></tr> <tr>  <td>10:15-10:50</td> <td>Invited Talk II</td></tr> <tr>  <td>10:50-11:30</td> <td>Two Short Papers</td></tr><tr>  <td>11:30-11:45</td> <td> Coffee Break</td></tr><tr>  <td>11:45-12:20</td> <td>Invited Talk III</td></tr><tr>  <td>12:20-13:00</td> <td>Two Short Papers</td></tr><tr>  <td>13:00-14:00</td> <td>On-site Lunch</td></tr><tr>  <td>14:00-15:00</td> <td>Three Breakout Working Groups, <br> tasked to critique   the morning sessions</td></tr><tr>  <td>15:00-15:30</td> <td>WG1 presentation &amp; discussion</td></tr><tr>  <td>15:30-15:45</td> <td>Coffee Break</td></tr><tr>  <td>15:45-16:15</td> <td>WG2 presentation &amp; discussion</td></tr><td>16:15-16:45</td> <td>WG3 presentation &amp; discussion</td></tr><tr>  <td>16:45-17:00</td> <td>Concluding remarks</td></tr></table> <P>Admission to the workshop is limited to 40 participants and will beestablished upon submission of a one page statement of interestincluding</P><UL><LI>Participant name, affiliation and contact details</LI><LI>Motivation for participating</LI><LI>Position statement</LI></UL><P>Those interested in giving a talk, should also submit a positionpaper (~1500 words).
