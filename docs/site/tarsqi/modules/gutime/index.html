TempEx, developed at MITRE,        is aimed at the ACE TIMEX2 standard (timex2.mitre.org) for recognizing        the        extents and normalized values of time expressions. TempEx handles both        absolute times (e.g., <code>June 2, 2003</code>) and relative times (e.g.,        <code>Thursday</code>) by means of a number of tests on the local context.        Lexical triggers like <code>today</code>, <code>yesterday</code>, and        <code>tomorrow</code>, when used in a specific sense, as well as words        which indicate a positional        offset, like <code>next month</code>, <code>last year</code>, <code>this        coming Thursday</code> are resolved based on computing direction and        magnitude with        respect to a reference time, which is usually the document publication      time. </p>      <p>GUTime extends TempEx to handle time expressions based on the TimeML          TIMEX3 standard, which allows a functional style of encoding          offsets in time expressions. For example, <code>last week</code> could            be represented not only by the time value but also by an expression            that          could be evaluated to compute the value, namely, that it is the week          preceding the week of the document date. GUTime also handles a variety          of ACE TIMEX2 expressions not covered by TempEx, including durations,          a variety of temporal modifiers, and European date formats. GUTime            has been benchmarked on training data from the Time Expression Recognition          and Normalization task (timex2.mitre.org/tern.html) at .85, .78, and        .82 F-measure for timex2, text, and val fields respectively. </p>      <p>An example          of GUTime output is shown below, the added TIMEX3 is in bold type.</p>      <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" class="timemlExample">        <tr>          <td><p>In Washington <strong><tag>&lt;TIMEX3 tid=&quot;t1&quot; TYPE=&quot;DATE&quot; VAL=&quot;PRESENT_REF&quot; temporalFunction=&quot;true&quot; valueFromFunction=&quot;tf1&quot; anchorTimeID=&quot;t0&quot;&gt;</tag></strong>today<strong><tag>&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;</tag></strong>,              the Federal Aviation Administration released air traffic control            tapes from the night the TWA Flight eight hundred went down.</p>          </td>        </tr>      </table>                  <p>&nbsp;</p>    <h3>References</h3>    <p>Inderjeet Mani and George Wilson. 2000.
