Bush met with    Vladimir Putin in Moscow.</i>" We don't know exactly how long that    meeting lasted, but we do get <i>some</i> temporal information    from the sentence. We know the meeting lasted more than ten    seconds and less than one year. As we guess narrower and narrower    bounds, our chances of being correct go down.  Just how accurately    can we make duration judgments like this? How much agreement can    we expect among people? Will it be possible to extract this kind    of information from text automatically?</p>  <p>Extracting such implicit and vague typical durations of events    automatically is potentially very beneficial for applications that    aim to order events temporally. For example, whether two events    overlap or are in sequence often depends on their durations. If a    war started yesterday, we can be pretty sure it is still going on    today. If a hurricane started last year, we can be sure it is over    by now.</p><!-- (shortened a bit and replaced with the paragraph below, MV)  <p>We have developed annotation guidelines to minimize discrepant    judgments and annotated all the 48 non-Wall-Street-Journal    (non-WSJ) news articles (2132 events), as well as 10 WSJ articles    (156 events) from the TimeBank corpus; we have developed a method    for measuring inter-annotator agreement when the judgments are    intervals on a scale; and we have showed that machine learning    techniques applied to this data yield <i>coarse-grained</i> event    duration information, considerably outperforming a baseline and    approaching human performance.</p>-->  <p>We have developed annotation guidelines to minimize discrepant    judgments and annotated 58 document from the TimeBank corpus,    adding durations to 2288 events.
