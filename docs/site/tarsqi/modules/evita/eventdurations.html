Bush met with Vladimir Putin      in Moscow.</i>" We don't know exactly how      long that meeting lasted, but we do get <i>some</i> temporal information from the sentence. We know      the meeting lasted more than ten seconds and less than one year. As we      guess narrower and narrower bounds, our chances of being correct go down.      Just how accurately can we make duration judgments like this? How much      agreement can we expect among people? Will it be possible to extract this      kind of information from text automatically?</p>  <p>The goal of the project is to extract such implicit and vague typical durations    of events from text automatically. This research is potentially very important    in applications in which the time course of events is to be extracted from    news. For example, whether two events overlap or are in sequence often depends    very much on their durations. If a war started yesterday, we can be    pretty sure it is still going on today. If a hurricane started last    year, we can be sure it is over by now.</p>  <p>We have developed annotation guidelines to minimize discrepant judgments    and annotated all the 48 non-Wall-Street-Journal (non-WSJ) news articles    (2132 events), as well as 10 WSJ articles (156 events) from the TimeBank    corpus; we have developed a method for measuring inter-annotator agreement    when the judgments are intervals on a scale; and we have showed that machine    learning techniques applied to this data yield <i>coarse-grained</i> event    duration information, considerably outperforming a baseline and approaching    human performance.</p>  <p>Our annotation has been integrated into the TimeBank corpus, and is available    from </p>  <p><ahref="http://www.isi.edu/~pan/EventDuration/annotations/">http://www.isi.edu/~pan/EventDuration/annotations/</a></p>  <p>References:</p>  <p>Feng Pan, Rutu Mulkar, and Jerry      R.
