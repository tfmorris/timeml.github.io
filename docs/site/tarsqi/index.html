These workshops created the infrastructure for temporal reasoning, by  establishing a rich specification language called TimeML for representing events,  temporal expressions, and the relations between them, and creating a gold standard  called TIMEBANK1.1, for testing algorithms such as those being proposed in  this application. <br>          <br>  The TARSQI Project will allow AQUAINT developers and analysts to sort and organize  information in NL texts based on their temporal characteristics. Specifically,  we will develop algorithms that tag mentions of events in NL texts, tag time  expressions and normalize them, and temporally anchor and order the events.  We will also develop temporal reasoning algorithms that operate on the resulting  event-time graphs for each document. These temporal reasoning algorithms will  include a graph query capability, that will, for example, find when a particular  event occurs, or which events occur in a time period. They will also include  a temporal closure algorithm that will allow more complete coverage of queries  (by using the transitivity of temporal precedence and inclusion relationships  to insert additional links into the graph), and a timelining algorithm that  provides chronological views at various granularities of an event graph as  a whole or a region of it. We will also develop a capability to compare event  graphs across documents. Finally, we will develop a model of the typical durations  of various kinds of events.<h4><font color="#A52A2A">Objectives</font></h4><ul>  <li type="disc">Develop technology for annotating temporal information in natural    language text, extracting temporal information from text, and reasoning about    temporal information</li></ul><ul><li type="disc">Make technology available for use in improved question-answering    in AQUAINT, as well as for embedding in analyst toolkits</li></ul><ul><li type="disc">Integrate tools with AQUAINT testbed</li></ul>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
