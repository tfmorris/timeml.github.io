All these tools can be used as standaloneprograms that automatically identify TimeML tags in a document, butthey can also be calledin sequence as in figure 1.<blockquote>  <table cellpadding="5">    <tbody>      <tr>        <td class="border"> <img src="tarsqiArchitecture.png" height="330" width="300"></td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td align="center">Figure 1: TARSQI Component Architecture</td>      </tr>    </tbody>  </table></blockquote>In the following sections we describe the TARSQI modules that identifyand extract TimeML-based entities and relations in news texts.<h3>GUTime</h3>The GUTime tagger is based on MITRE's Tempex tagger and recognizes theextents and normalized values of time expressions. It handles bothabsolute times (e.g., <i>June 2, 2003</i>) and relative times (e.g.,<i>Thursday, today, yesterday</i>). GUTime extends TempEx to handletime expressions based on the TimeML TIMEX3 standard (timeml.org),which allows a functional style of encoding offsets in timeexpressions. For example, <i>last week</i> could be represented notonly by the time value but also by an expression that could beevaluated to compute the value, namely, that it is the week precedingthe week of the document date. GUTime also handles durations, avariety of temporal modifiers, and European date formats. GUTime hasbeen benchmarked on training data from the Time Expression Recognitionand Normalization task (timex2.mitre.org/tern.html) at 0.85, 0.78, and0.82 F-measure for timex2, text, and val fields respectively.GUTime has been downloaded by 22 groups worldwide, listed below.<h3>EVITA</h3>Evita is an domain-independent event recognition tool that performs twomain tasks:robust event identification; and analysis of grammatical features, suchas tense and aspect. Event identification is based on the notion ofevent as defined in TimeML. Evita uses dictionaries, hand-craftedrules and machine ruling, depending on the subtask at hand. Evitarelies on preprocessed input with part-of-speech tags andchunks. Current performance of Evita against TimeBank is 0.75precision, 0.87 recall, and 0.80 F-measure. Precision is actually muchhigher, but takes a hitdue to Evita's over-generation of generic events, which were notannotated in TimeBank.<h3>Modal Parsing</h3><p>Slinket is a modal parser whose task is to automaticallyintroduce SLINKs in text, which in TimeML specify subordinatingrelationsbetween pairs of events; it then classifies them into factive,counterfactive, evidential, negative evidential, and modal categories,based onthe modal force of the subordinating event. Slinket requires chunkedinput with events. Slinket evaluates against TimeBank at 0.91precision and 0.59 recall (F-measure 0.71).</p><p>S2T is an added module to Slinket. It derives temporal informationfrom modality: it takes SLINKs and creates TLINKs. It uses tense andaspect information as well as structural information provided bySlinket's rule set. S2T can be viewed as a specialization ofGUTenLink (see next section). S2T was evaluated by hand against aset of 180 SLINKs and checked in at 0.77 precision and 0.83 recall.</p><h3>TLINK Generation</h3>The GUTenLINK tagger uses 187 hand-developed syntactic and lexicalrules.The tagger takes pairs of TLINKable items (event and/or time) andsearches for the single most-confident rule to apply to it, if any, toproduce a labeled TLINK between those items. Each (if-then) rule has aleft-hand side which consists of a conjunction of tests based onTimeML-related features, and a right-hand side which is an assignmentto one of the TimeML TLINK classes. The rules are grouped into severaldifferent classes: (i) the event is anchored with or without a signalto a time expression within the same clause (ii) the event is anchoredwith-out a signal to the document date speech time frame (as in thecase of reporting verbs in news, which are often at or offset slightlyfrom the speech time) (iii) an event is linked to another event in thesame sentence and (iv) the event in a main clause of one sentence isanchored with a signal or tense and/or aspect cue to an event in themain clause of the previous sentence. GUTENLINK has a 56.19% accuracywhen evaluated for TLINK labeling on the TimeBank 1.2 (186 documents),and 88.53% accuracy on the Opinion Corpus (73 documents). Thisaccuracy is sufficient for it to be useful as a preprocessor for usein human TLINK annotation.<h3>SputLink</h3>SputLink is a temporal closure and reasoning component that takes knowntemporalrelations in a text and derives new implied relations from them, ineffect making explicit what was implicit. SputLink adds global TLINKSthat are not easily derived by other means. In addition, SputLink canbe used to detect inconsistencies in an annotated document.A SputLink evaluation on TimeBank showed that SputLink more thanquadrupled the amount of temporal links in TimeBank, and addsnon-local links that were systematically missed by the humanannotators. Sputlink also makes a complete annotation feasible bystructuring the annotation task. Hidden temporal information in thetext is computed and output by Sputlink.<h3>Current Work</h3>Current issues are the following:<ol>  <li> The preprocessing pipeline depended heavily on the AlembicNatural Language tools, which turned out to be rather brittle and arenot supported anymore. We're converting to using the Brill tagger, ahome-grown stemmer, and a customized Yamcha chunker.  </li>  <li> Interaction between Evita and GUTime is not optimal.  </li>  <li> GUTenLink has been redesigned and is currently being rewritten.  </li>  <li> SputLink is not hooked up yet with our standard TimeML parsingand generation modules.  </li></ol><p>Finally, we envision GUTenLINK and S2T as components in a largermachine-learning based framework for ordering events. Initial work onmachine learning of TLINKs has been extremely encouraging.Anothercomponent which will be developed will leverage document-levelinference which required annotation of a reference time for the eventin each finite clause.</p><br></body></html>
