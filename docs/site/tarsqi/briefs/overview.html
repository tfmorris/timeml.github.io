All these tools can be used as standaloneprograms that automatically identify TimeML tags in a document, but they can also be calledin sequence as in figure 1.<!--<ol><li> GUTime<li> Evita<li> Slinket<li> S2T<li> GUTenLink<li> SputLink</ol>--><blockquote><table cellpadding="5"><tr> <td class="border"> <img src="tarsqiArchitecture.png" width="300" height="330"></td></tr><tr> <td align="center">Figure 1: TARSQI Component Architecture</td></tr></table></blockquote>In the following sections we describe the TARSQI modules that identifyand extract TimeML-based entities and relations in  news texts.<h3>GUTime</h3>The GUTime tagger is based on MITRE's Tempex tagger and recognizes theextents and normalized values of time expressions. It handles bothabsolute times (e.g., <i>June 2, 2003</i>) and relative times (e.g.,<i>Thursday, today, yesterday</i>). GUTime extends TempEx to handletime expressions based on the TimeML TIMEX3 standard (timeml.org),which allows a functional style of encoding offsets in timeexpressions. For example, <i>last week</i> could be represented notonly by the time value but also by an expression that could beevaluated to compute the value, namely, that it is the week precedingthe week of the document date. GUTime also handles durations, avariety of temporal modifiers, and European date formats. GUTime hasbeen benchmarked on training data from the Time Expression Recognitionand Normalization task (timex2.mitre.org/tern.html) at 0.85, 0.78, and0.82 F-measure for timex2, text, and val fields respectively.GUTime has been downloaded by 22 groups worldwide, listed below. <h3>EVITA</h3>Evita is an domain-independent event recognition tool that performs two main tasks:robust event identification; and analysis of grammatical features, suchas tense and aspect. Event identification is based on the notion ofevent as defined in TimeML. Evita uses dictionaries, hand-craftedrules and machine ruling, depending on the subtask at hand. Evitarelies on preprocessed input with part-of-speech tags andchunks. Current performance of Evita against TimeBank is 0.75precision, 0.87 recall, and 0.80 F-measure. Precision is actually much higher, but takes a hitdue to Evita's over-generation of generic events, which were notannotated in TimeBank.<h3>Modal Parsing</h3><p>Slinket is a modal parser whose task is to automaticallyintroduce SLINKs in text, which in TimeML specify subordinating relationsbetween pairs of events; it then classifies them into factive,counterfactive, evidential, negative evidential, and modal categories, based onthe modal force of the subordinating event. Slinket requires chunkedinput with events. Slinket evaluates against TimeBank at 0.91precision and 0.59 recall (F-measure 0.71).<p>S2T is an added module to Slinket. It derives temporal informationfrom modality: it takes SLINKs and creates TLINKs. It uses tense andaspect information as well as structural information provided bySlinket's rule set. S2T can be viewed as a specialization ofGUTenLink (see next section). S2T was evaluated by hand against aset of 180 SLINKs and checked in at 0.77 precision and 0.83 recall.<h3>TLINK Generation</h3>The GUTenLINK tagger uses 187 hand-developed syntactic and lexical rules.The tagger takes pairs of TLINKable items (event and/or time) andsearches for the single most-confident rule to apply to it, if any, toproduce a labeled TLINK between those items. Each (if-then) rule has aleft-hand side which consists of a conjunction of tests based onTimeML-related features, and a right-hand side which is an assignmentto one of the TimeML TLINK classes. The rules are grouped into severaldifferent classes: (i) the event is anchored with or without a signalto a time expression within the same clause (ii) the event is anchoredwith-out a signal to the document date speech time frame (as in thecase of reporting verbs in news, which are often at or offset slightlyfrom the speech time) (iii) an event is linked to another event in thesame sentence and (iv) the event in a main clause of one sentence isanchored with a signal or tense and/or aspect cue to an event in themain clause of the previous sentence. GUTENLINK has a 56.19% accuracywhen evaluated for TLINK labeling on the TimeBank 1.2 (186 documents),and 88.53% accuracy on the Opinion Corpus (73 documents). Thisaccuracy is sufficient for it to be useful as a preprocessor for usein human TLINK annotation. <h3>SputLink</h3>SputLink is a temporal closure and reasoning component that takes known temporalrelations in a text and derives new implied relations from them, ineffect making explicit what was implicit. SputLink adds global TLINKSthat are not easily derived by other means. In addition, SputLink canbe used to detect inconsistencies in an annotated document.A SputLink evaluation on TimeBank showed that SputLink more thanquadrupled the amount of temporal links in TimeBank, and addsnon-local links that were systematically missed by the humanannotators. Sputlink also makes a complete annotation feasible bystructuring the annotation task. Hidden temporal information in thetext is computed and output by Sputlink. <h3>Current Work</h3>Current issues are the following:<ol><li> The preprocessing pipeline depended heavily on the AlembicNatural Language tools, which turned out to be rather brittle and arenot supported anymore. We're converting to using the Brill tagger, ahome-grown stemmer, and a customized Yamcha chunker.<li> Size of TimeBank. Currently, TimeBank is going through a thirdround of sanitation, due to distribution by the Linguistic DataConsortium. This is helpful for evaluation purposes but does notaddress the issue that TimeBank really is too small formachine-learning purposes.<li> Interaction between Evita and GUTime is not optimal.<li> GUTenLink has been redesigned and is currently being rewritten.<li> SputLink is not hooked up yet with our standard TimeML parsingand generation modules.<li> Some minor licensing issues prevent distribution of Evita,SLinket and S2T to non-Tarsqi participants. SputLink currently usesonly qualitative temporal infomation, it will be extended to usequantitative information, allowing it to reason over durations.</ol><p>Finally, we envision GUTenLINK and S2T as components in a largermachine-learning based framework for ordering events. Initial work on machine learning of TLINKs has been extremely encouraging.Anothercomponent which will be developed will leverage document-levelinference which required annotation of a reference time for the eventin each finite clause.<h3>GUTime Licensees as of 1/25/2006</h3><ol><li>Philippe Muller<br>muller@irit.fr<br>118 Route de Narbonne, 31062 Toulouse Cedex 4, France<br>IRIT Universitity<li>Poh Lian Choong<br>pohlian.choong@dsto.defence.gov.au<br>P.O.Box 1500, Edinburgh SA 5111, Australia<br>DSTO<li>Nancy Ide <br>Professor  of Computer Science <br>Vassar College <br>Poughkeepsie, NY 12604-0520 USA <br>Tel: +1 845 437-5988 Fax: +1 845 437-7498 <br>ide@cs.vassar.edu<li>Manal EL ZANT<br>el.zant@medecine.univ-mrs.fr<br>37 bvd Jean Moulin, 13005 Marseille<br>Equipe BioMathematique et Informatique Medicale-LIF<li>Yejun Wu<br>wuyj@umiacs.umd.edu<br>4120A Hornbake Bldg South Wing, UMCP, MD 20742<br>UMCP<li>Kathryn Conant<br>kconant@frontiernet.net<br>438 Mountainside Road<br>Great Blue Circle LLC<li>Beth Sundheim<br>Beth.sundheim@navy.mil<br>SPAWAR Systems Center<br>San Diego<li>Dennis Egan<br>Admin@eess.us<br>3062 McKinnon Way, Oakton, VA 22124<br>The George Washington University<br>Working for Ministry of Health, Singapore<li>Richard Scherl<br>rscherl@monmouth.edu<br>West Long Branch, New Jersey<br>Monmouth University<li>Steven Bethard<br>steven.bethard@colorado.edu<br> The Center for Spoken Language Research,  Campus Box 594,  Boulder, Colorado 80309-0594<br>University of Colorado at Boulder<li>Andrea Setzer<br>    Sheffield University<br>A.Setzer@dcs.shef.ac.uk<li>Paul Miller<br>millerp@mit.edu<br>351 Mass Ave, Cambridge Ma<br>MIT<li>William Yao M.
