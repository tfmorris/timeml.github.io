It integrates extraction        of events and time expressions with creation of temporal links, using        a        set of        mostly        independent        modules,        while ensuring        consistency with a constraint propagation component. The glue that keeps        all the modules together is the TimeML language.</p>      <p>TTK contains the following components:</p>      <ol>        <li>GUTime - extraction of time expressions</li>        <li>Evita - event extraction</li>        <li>Slinket - modal parsing</li>        <li>S2T -  temporal repercussions of modal relations</li>        <li>Blinker - opportunistic pattern-based parsing of temporal relations,          based on GutenLink</li>        <li>Classifier - MaxEnt classifier trained on TimeBank</li>        <li>Sputlink - constraint propagation (aka temporal closure)</li>        <li>Link Merger - uses Sputlink to ensure consistency of all relations</li>      </ol>            <p>The long-term vision with TTK is to provide a set of tools        that can  be adapted to new data and that would let the developer         set up a processing chain to fit his or her particular needs.        To that        end, the toolkit will include tools to inspect and edit dictionaries        and pattern sets as well        as tools to train machine learning components on new data.</p>      <p>The toolkit comes bundled with a          GUI and an extension of the Tango annotation tool, an extension including        TBox, a compact visual          representation          language for TimeML          graphs. See the <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a> page for          some snapshots of the toolkit in action.</p>      <p>TTK version 1.0 is available, refer tot the <a href="download.html">download</a> page    for details.</p></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
