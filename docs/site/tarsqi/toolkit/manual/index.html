TTK extracts timeexpressions, events, subordination links and temporal links; inaddition, it ensures consistency of temporalinformation. See <a href="http://tarsqi.org">http://tarsqi.org</a> formore general information on the TARSQI project and for descriptions ofTTK and its components. The Tarsqi Toolkit comes bundled with theTango annotation tool (<ahref="http://timeml.org/site/tango/">http://timeml.org/site/tango/</a>)and a graphical user interface.<p>This manual contains the following sections:<ol><li><a href="#license">Copyright and License</a></li><li><a href="#prereq">Prerequisites</a></li><li><a href="#install">Installation</a></li><li><a href="#using">Using the Tarsqi Toolkit</a></li><li><a href="#gui">Using the Toolkit GUI</a></li><!--<li><a href="#extending">Extending the Tarsqi Toolkit</a></li>--><li><a href="#codedocs">Code Documentation</a></li><li><a href="#contrib">Contributors</a></li><li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li><li><a href="#future">Future Work</a></li></ol><a name=license><h3>1.

Prerequisites</h3></a><p>The toolkit requires at least version 2.3 of Python and version 5.8of Perl. Older Perl versions may work. The toolkit has been tested onthe following platforms:</p>
<ul><li>Red Hat Linux 5, with Python 2.4.3 and Perl 5.8.8<li>Mac OS X, with Python 2.3.5 and Perl 5.8.8</ul>The Perl installation needs to include the <code>XML::Parser</code>module. This is problematic for those who use OS X because the versionof Perl that is bundled with OS X does not contain<code>XML::Parser</code>. You have several options here. One is todownload and install XML::Parser from <ahref="http://cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. Another is to install ActivePerlfrom <a href="http://activestate.com/">ActiveState</a>. <p>The toolkit graphical user interface requires the wxPython package.<p><strong>Note to Windows users.</strong><br/> There currently is no neatly packaged Windows version of TTK. However,most code is written to be cross-platform and the toolkit can be madeto run on Windows (albeit with some effort). We are currently workingon a neat package for Windows by integrating or better integrating thepart-of-speech tagger and the MaxEnt classifier. A Windows-friendlyversion will be released asap.<a name=install><h3>3. Installation</h3></a>This is a three step process: (i) unpacking the archive, (ii)installing the part-of-speech tagger and (iii) setting up TTK for yourplatform and environment.<h4>Downloading and Unpacking the Archive</h4> Unpack the archive into the desired directory. For example, on Linux,you would need to type<blockquote><code>% gunzip -c ttk-1.0.tar.gz | tar xp</code></blockquote>This will unpack TTK into a directory named <code>ttk-1.0</code>.<h4>Installing the Part-of-Speech Tagger</h4>The Tarsqi toolkit is designed to work seamlessly with the IMSTreeTagger. Download the packages needed for your platform from the <ahref="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/">TreeTaggerwebsite</a> and follow the directions. The TreeTagger needs to beinstalled in<blockquote><code>ttk-1.0/code/components/preprocessing/treetagger/</code></blockquote>and this directory needs to have sub directories <code>bin</code> and<code>lib</code>. <p>Other POS taggers can be used instead of the IMS TreeTagger. Theeasiest case would be a tagger that uses the same <a target=NEWhref="tagger_in.txt">input format</a> as the TreeTagger and createsfiles in the same <a target=NEW href="tagger_out.txt">outputformat</a>. In that case, only the <code>tag_fragment</code> method in<blockquote><code>ttk-1.0/code/components/preprocessor/wrapper.py</code></blockquote>will need to be edited according to your needs. A future version ofthe toolkit will make it easier to install other taggers.<h4>Platform-specific setup</h4>Platform-specific setup needs to be performed by changing the workingdirectory to <code>ttk-1.0/code</code> and running the<code>setup.py</code> script. The toolkit comes bundled withclassifier binaries and the setup script installs the correctversion. The only two platforms for which classifier binaries areincluded are Mac OSX and Linux.The script also makes a guess as to where to find a Perl executablethat is sufficient for TTK (that is, it includes an XML parser). Ingeneral, it will simply use <code>perl</code> as the Perl commandunless it finds an ActivePerl distribution. This default can beoverruled by either supplying arguments to the setup script or byediting the file <code>settings.txt</code>. The two most likelyways to use the script are:<blockquote><code>% python setup.py platform=linux<br/>% python setup.py platform=osx perl=/usr/local/ActivePerl-5.8/bin/perl</code></blockquote>The first example sets up the classifier for linux, and sets the Perlpath to <code>perl</code> (unless specified otherwise in<code>settings.txt</code>). The second installs the classifier for osxand sets the Perl path to the given value. You could also use the perlswitch to point to other non-standard perl locations. See thedocumentation in <code>setup.py</code> for more details.<p/>A future version of TTK will have added Windows as a supported platform.<a name=using><h3>4. Using the TARSQI Toolkit</h3></a>To run the TARSQI Toolkit, open a terminal, change the workingdirectory to the <code>code</code> directory of the distribution andtype<blockquote><code>python tarsqi.py &lt;input_type&gt; [flags] &lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;<br/>python tarsqi.py &lt;input_type&gt; [flags] &lt;indir&gt; &lt;outdir&gt;</code></blockquote>The following input types are defined:<blockquote><code>simple-xml</code><blockquote>An input type that should be used for default XML. It assumes that adocument contains a tag named TEXT that wraps the data that need to beparsed and that the data have not yet been processed in any way. Thevalue of the tag that wraps the data can be overridden using thecontent_tag flag (see below). This input type can be used for thefiles in <code>code/data/in/simple-xml</code>.</blockquote><code>timebank</code><blockquote>This input type is very similar to <code>simple-xml</code>, the maindifference is that it activates a component that parses documentcreation times for the various TimeBank formats. This input type canbe used for the files in <code>code/data/in/TimeBank</code>, whichconsists of all TimeBank files with all tags (except some documentlevel tags) stripped out.  </blockquote><code>rte3</code><blockquote>Use this input type when processing pre-processed data from<code>code/data/in/RTE3</code>, which contains data from the <ahref="http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE3/">Third PascalTextual Entailment Challenge</a>. </blockquote></blockquote>Flags are feature-value pairs where the feature and value areseparated by an equals sign. The following flags are defined:<blockquote><code>extension=String</code><blockquote>Puts a restriction on what files are processed, this is useful whenprocessing an entire directory. The default is the empty string, whichmatches any extension.</blockquote><code>trap_errors=(True|False)</code><blockquote>Determines whether errors inside of components are trapped. Thedefault is that errors are not trapped.</blockquote><code>content_tag=String</code><blockquote>Can be used to overrule the default content tag ofthe input type.</blockquote><code>pipeline=String</code><blockquote>Can be used to overrule the default pipeline determined by the datasource identifier. A pipeline is a comma-separated string of componentnames. Allowed component names are <code>PREPROCESSOR, GUTIME, EVITA,SLINKET, S2T, BLINKER, CLASSIFIER</code> and<code>LINK_MERGER</code>. The order of the components in the pipelinespecification is significant. Some examples are:<blockquote><code>pipeline=PREPROCESSOR,GUTIME,EVITA<br>pipeline=SLINKET,S2T,BLINKER,CLASSIFIER,LINK_MERGER</code></blockquote>The first example instructs TTK to take a file, preprocess it and addtime expressions and events. For the second example, preprocessing,times and events are taken for granted and only links are added. </blockquote></blockquote><a name=gui><h3>5. Using the Toolkit GUI</h3></a>The Toolkit GUI can be used by typing one of<blockquote><code>% pythonw gui.py<br/>% python gui.py</code></blockquote>Use <code>pythonw</code> when available, <code>python</code>otherwise. In both cases the wxPython package needs to beinstalled. The GUI has three advantages over using the command lineversion:<ol><li>It is faster when using on a file-by-file basis because alllibraries are loaded either at start-up or when the first file is processed.<li>It is easier to use.<li>It allows the user to type some input and see what happens.</ol>The main disadvantage is that it is not possible to process all filesin a directory. Here's a screen shot:<blockquote><img src="gui-1.png" width="800" height="480"/></blockquote>There is no separate manual for the GUI, but usage should be prettystraightforward. Functionality can be summed up as follows:<ul><li>Use "Load File" to select a file to be processed. <li>Use "Load Text" to type in text. This will create a file inthe <code>data/in/User</code> directory, which is then selected as theinput file.<li>Use the"Document Type", "Trap Errors" and "Content Tag" pull-downsand text field to enter processing options. Setting the "DocumentType" option will set the "Content Tag" text field to the default forthe document type. It will also select the default components for thedocument type. The default components can be overridden by checkingand unchecking the component check boxes. Note that the threepre-processing components are all either on or off.<li>Use "Process File" to process the input file conform to the selected settings.<li>Finally, "View Results" will pop up a new window that displays theprocessing results in a more informative way (the large text field inthe control panel just prints the result file as is). The buttons inthe results view control what is shown in it. There are twoexceptions: (i) the "Graph" button will start the Tango annotationtool on the results file, showing a graph of the annotation andincluding a "TBox" button which displays an alternative format, and(ii) the "TBox" button doesn't do anything yet, in the future it willprovide a more direct way to the TBox representation.</ul><!--<a name=extending><h3>5. Extending the Tarsqi Toolkit</h3></a>--><a name=codedocs><h3>6. Code Documentation</h3></a>Documentation of the code is uneven: some modules are well-documented,other have spotty and underwhelming documentation, and yet others arenot documented at all. For some modules, documentation files can becreated using the <code>pydoc</code> command. Unfortunately, thiscommand crashes on many of the toolkit modules.To create browsable documentation in <code>ttk-1.0/docs/code</code> youcan use the <code>make_documentation.py</code> script:<blockquote><code>% cd ttk-1.0<br>% python make_documentation.py </code></blockquote>This creates an <code>index.html</code> with a list of links to allmodules. For each module, and each class and function in that module,the documentation strings are printed. There are also links to thesource code of each function.<a name=contrib><h3>7. Contributors</h3></a>Many people have contributed to the Tarsqi toolkit, they are listedhere in alphabetical order: Catherine Havasi, Seokbae Jang, BobKnippen, Congmin Lee, Inderjeet Mani, Emin Mimaroglu, JessicaMoszkowicz, Feng Pan, Alex Plotnick, James Pustejovsky, Hongyuan Qiu,Anna Rumshisky, Roser Saur&iacute;, Barry Schiffman, Amber Stubbs,Marc Verhagen, and Ben Wellner.<p>The Tango annotation tool was developed by Linda van Guilder, AndrewSee, Bob Knippen and Alex Baron.<a name=contact><h3>8. Contact</h3></a>If you have problems installing the toolkit or if you want to report abug, please send an email to ttk-bugs@timeml.org. When reporting abug, please tell us what platform you're using (including Perl andPython versions) and include a file that illustrates the errantbehavior. A database with known issues will be made available on theweb site.<p>Suggestions, criticisms, disappointments, feature requests and kudosare also welcome at the above address.<a name=future><h3>9. Future Work</h3></a>The next major revision of the TARSQI Toolkit will be numbered 1.1 and willbe released in early 2008. Minor revisions will be released withversion number 1.0.X and will concentrate on bug fixes (as well as onproviding a non-problematic Windows version).<p>The following major changes to the code base are now in progress orunder consideration:<ol><li>Re-implement the temporal closure code into Python and integrate itbetter with the toolkit. Includes major speed optimizations (thetemporal closure components is by far the slowest component of thetoolkit and it slows down to a crawl on large documents).<li>Re-implement GUTime in Python, splitting it into two components,one to add the TIMEX3 tags and one to fill in the VAL field.<li>Eliminate all remaining Perl components (glue scripts and filteringscripts) and replace them with Python components<li>Use standoff annotation instead of in-line XML. This would make itmuch easier to deal with existing tags.<li>Finish porting all rule types from GutenLink to Blinker<li>Hook up the toolkit to other pre-processing components (forexample the NLTK toolkit).<li>Add browsers and editors for the dictionaries and pattern sets.<li>Improve on the merging code. It seems to throw away a few to manytemporal links that are considered high-precision (most notable linksbetween timex tags generated by Blinker).<li>Add a <code>text</code> document type.</ol>A much longer list of feature requests and known bugs will be put onthe toolkit website in the near future.</body></html>
