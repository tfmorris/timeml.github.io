Place      the gzipped distribution of Alembic Workbench in this      directory.<li>  (1) Change directory to this top level AWB directory (with "cd").<li>  (2) Ungzip and untar the distribution file (or, if you have a      tape version of the distribution, untar it from tape).<li>  (3) Set two environment variables, one (AWB) being the path of the      "top level" Alembic Workbench directory, and the second      (AWB_REL) being the version number for the version being      installed.<li>  (4) Run the installation script from this directory.<li>  (5) Create (or, if this is an update of a previous Workbench      installation, remove and re-create) a link from $AWB/awb.cshrc      to $AWB/awb-<version>/awb.cshrc, created in step 1.      All users who wish to use the Alembic Workbench should      execute the $AWB/awb.cshrc script to define the various      environment variables used by the Workbench.<li>  (6) Run the pre-processing installation script (if applicable).<li>  (7) Optional: Install Alembic Pre-processing scripts and POS lexicon.<li>  (8) Optional: Comment on disk space usage.</menu><p> To install the Alembic Workbench (AWB)<menu><li>  (0) Prior to un-tarring the contents of a distribution, one should      create a directory in which to place the Alembic Workbench code      and its declarative files.  We will refer to this directory as      the "top level" Workbench directory, or AWB.  After this is      created, place the gzipped tar distribution file within it.      This file will have one of the following names: awb-2.2.tar.gz,      awb-2.2-nopp.tar.gz or awb-2.2-nolisp.tar.gz.  If you are      installing from a tape, the file is in tar format on the tape,      so you should proceed to the next step.<li>  (1) Change directory to the "top level" directory (AWB), via:<pre>         unix> cd <top-level-AWB-dir></pre>      replacing the <top-level-AWB-dir> reference with the actual      path on your system.<li>  (2) (a) If you are installing from a tape, then untar the      contents of the tape, using the following command:<pre>         unix> tar -xvf <tape-device></pre>      (b) If you are installing from a gzipped, tar distribution      file, then first ungzip the file, as follows:<pre>         unix> gunzip <distribution-version>.tar.gz</pre>      or, more efficiently (since there is not intermediate .tar file      created:<pre>         unix> gunzip --stdout <distribution-version>.tar.gz | tar -xvf -</pre>      where <distribution-version> will be something like one of the      following: awb-1.20, awb-1.20-nopp or awb-1.20-nolisp, depending      upon whether you have a complete distribution (including all of      Alembic and its preprocessing scripts), a distribution without      Alembic, or a partial Alembic Workbench distribution that      excludes a lisp binary image used by some of the Workbench      utilities, respectively.      Then, untar the ungzipped file as follows:<pre>         unix> tar -xvf <distribution-version>.tar</pre>      where <distribution-version> is the same as above.  This will      result in the creation of a subdirectory awb-1.20 in the top      level Workbench directory (AWB).  This subdirectory is referred      to as the AWB_REL_DIR in this and other documentation.  (3) Set two environment variables as follows:<pre>         unix> setenv AWB <top-level-Alembic-Workbench-directory></pre>      This directory specification should not include the final, trailing      slash.  The "top level" directory is the one described in steps 0      and 1.  Then set the other environment variable:<pre>         unix> setenv AWB_REL <version-number></pre>      This environment variable should be set to the version currently      being installed.  For example, if you are installing version 2.2,      then you would say "setenv AWB_REL 2.2".  This version number should      *not* include the "awb-" prefix.  (4) Having defined the environment variables above, then proceed to      execute the installation script, as follows:<pre>         unix> $AWB/awb-$AWB_REL/install/install-awb</pre><menu><li>      (a) The first step of the script is to define the other main      environment variable, AWB_REL_DIR.<li>      (b) The next task performed by this script is to define the      installation- and version-specific awb.cshrc file.  (It is this      file that should be executed by anyone wishing to use the      Alembic Workbench.  See below for more details.  This script      defines a number of other version- and OS-dependent environment      variables.)<li>      (c) The script will then proceed to transfer a number of      directories and their contents from $AWB_REL_DIR to $AWB.  These      directories contain data and declaration files that can be      edited and otherwise modifed by users.  All the files and      directories that remain under $AWB_REL_DIR will be set to      read-only, to protect them from inadvertent modification,      whereas virtually all the data and declaration files will be      world read/write accessible.  (Both of these can be controlled      by the site installer, of course.) The script will not write      over any files that already exist in those version-independent      directories (from previous installations).<li>      (d) The final step of this script is the execution of the      version- and site-specific setup script $AWB_REL_DIR/awb.cshrc.      This script defines a number of environment variables in the      current shell environment, such as $AWB, $AWB_REL_DIR,      $TCL_LIBRARY, etc.  This script should be included in the      default .cshrc files of those people who are likely to want to      use the Workbench.  The installer should look at this script      carefully.  Notice that if the user is already using Tcl/Tk, it      redefines the environment variables TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY.      If these libraries are not consistent with the installed version      of Tcl/Tk, *and* if users are actively using Tcl/Tk for other      systems, the installer may wish to modify this script so that      the Alembic Workbench uses the site-installed version of Tcl/Tk.</menu><li>  (5) At the conclusion of these steps a new version of the Alembic      Workbench has been installed.  After testing that this is the      case, and that it works appropriately, the installer should then      change directory (cd) to $AWB and define a link as follows:<pre>          unix> ln -s $AWB_REL_DIR/awb.cshrc awb.cshrc</pre><p>      If such a link already exists, pointing to an earlier version,      the installer should remove this link prior to executing the      above.  The "sourcing" of this script should be probably be      placed in the .csrhc files of all who intend to use the Alembic      Workbench (see below).<p>      Before running the Workbench, the user needs to explicitly      "source" this cshrc script as follows:<pre>         unix> source $AWB/awb.cshrc</pre><p>      To save space, the installer will probably want either to remove      the whole sub-directory used by the earlier version, or tar and      gzip it (in case it is needed because of problems in the      distribution files and/or tape).<p>         NOTE to installer:  The present version of Alembic         Workbench has been built and tested using Tcl 7.4          and Tk 4.0.  These versions of Tcl/Tk have been            delivered along with the Workbench, and by default         are used in running the Workbench.  If you wish            to integrate the Workbench with an installed ver-          sion of Tcl/Tk that is compatible, *and* you have          installed a version of the Workbench that includes         the .tcl source code (and not a "p-compiled"               version in which only .ptcl files are available            in the gui subdirectory) you may do so by setting          the following environment variables appropriately:                                                           <pre>             AWB_TCL_DIR  Should point to directory in                               which the tclsh and wish                                   binaries can be found.                        TK_LIBRARY   Should point to appropriate                   TCL_LIBRARY  libraries for Tk and Tcl.        </pre>                                                           <p>         If the versions are compatible and the Workbench           runs without any problems, you could save some             space by deleting the subdirectories below.                (But don't don't delete them until confirming              that the default Tcl/Tk installation is indeed             compatible with Alembic Workbench.)                                                                          <pre>             $AWB_REL_DIR/TclTk-4.1.3 and                               $AWB_REL_DIR/TclTk-5.4                        </pre>                                                           <li>  (6) This distribution may include the Alembic natural language      processing system (consisting of a transformational rule-based      approach to phrase parsing) and its associated preprocessing      programs (for tokenizing, sentence tagging, part-of-speech      tagging, date tagging, etc.). For these systems to be available      to the user (via the Text Processing option under the Utilities      pulldown menu), you need to install them. Note, however, that      the Workbench is fully functional as a manual tagging      environment *without* the Alembic NLP system being installed.      (Some distributions may not include Alembic and its      preprocessing scripts at all.)  To install the preprocessing      programs, run the following script:<pre>         unix> $AWB_REL_DIR/install/install-preprocess</pre>      This script can take a long time, depending on the machine, the      fragmentation on the disk, etc., since it builds a fairly large      lexicon database.  The approximate amount of disk space that is      required for this is 60 MB.  Besides gunzipping the tar file,      most of the time consumed involves building the lexicon database.      If you experience any problems with this installation, please      contact John Aberdeen (see contact information below).  More      detailed information on the part-of-speech tagger can be found      within the $AWB/preprocess sub-directories, and is available      upon request from John Aberdeen.<p>      IMPORTANT: Until we find the nature of the incompatibility,      there are two perl scripts used in running various pre- and      post-processing scripts that must use perl4 and *not* perl5      (notwithstanding the supposed backward compatibility of perl5!).      Therefore, the installer should edit these scripts to have them      point to the local installation of perl4.  These scripts are:<pre>           $AWB_PP_SCRIPTS/prelembic           $AWB_TOOLS_DIR/copyptf                   $AWB_TOOLS_DIR/fast-ne-score             $AWB_TOOLS_DIR/index2html                $AWB_TOOLS_DIR/ne-index                  $AWB_TOOLS_DIR/normatt                   $AWB_TOOLS_DIR/print-phrases             $AWB_TOOLS_DIR/sgm2ptb                   $AWB_TOOLS_DIR/strip-tags     </pre><li>  (7) Using the workbench.<p>      Any user wishing to use the Workbench should first source the      file $AWB/awb.cshrc.  The repeat user of the workbench will      probably want to add source-ing this script to his or her own .cshrc      file.  This file is actually a link (defined above) to the current      version of a file that defines all the environment and path      variables needed for executing the Workbench.  Thereafter, the      user can invoke the Workbench in one of two ways:<pre>            unix> alembic-workbench</pre>      or simply:<pre>            unix> awb</pre><li>  (8) Other installation notes.<p>      NOTE ON SAVING DISK SPACE: The current distribution supports      running the Alembic Workbench on both SunOS 4.1.3 machines as      well as Solaris 2.4 and 2.5.x machines.  If you plan on running      the Workbench on only one of these OS's, then there are some      files you may tar and gzip (or simply remove) to save space.<p>      OS-specific directory pairs, one of which can be tarred and      gzipped if you do not need to use the workbench on that      platform:<pre>           $AWB_REL_DIR/TclTk-4.1.3      or   $AWB_REL_DIR/TclTk-5.4</pre><p>      OS-specific file and directory pairs, one of which can be      gzipped if you do not need to use the workbench on that platform:<pre>           $AWB_REL_DIR/lisp/awb.4.1.3.image (a link) and           $AWB_REL_DIR/lisp/sunos4/...      or   $AWB_REL_DIR/lisp/awb.5.4.image (a link) and           $AWB_REL_DIR/lisp/solaris/...</pre><p>      (Some installations may not even include 4.1.3, since we have not      yet obtained a runtime license for this version of Allegro CL.)      Of course, you will also probably want to remove from disk (but save      on tape) the original .tar.gz files from which this version of the      Alembic Workbench was derived.  Note that the preprocess.tar.gz file      from which the preprocessing scripts are built remains in the      directory $AWB_REL_DIR/, so after successfully installing those      scripts, the user may want to remove from disk this .tar.gz file      as well.  If you choose not to use the Alembic NLP system at all,      then all of the preprocess subdirectory and the preprocess.tar.gz      file may be removed, leaving approximately 20 MB used by all of      the Alembic Workbench proper.<p>      The preprocess include lexica and rules files for both mixed case      text and all-UPCASE text.  If the user wishes to keep the preprocess      but does not want to process all-UPCASE text, the following files may      be removed:<pre>	$PP_SCRIPTS_DIR/pos/lexicon-rules-utilities/CONTEXTUALRULES.upcase	$PP_SCRIPTS_DIR/pos/lexicon-rules-utilities/LEXICALRULES.upcase	$PP_SCRIPTS_DIR/pos/lexicon-rules-utilities/Makelexica-upcase.csh	$PP_SCRIPTS_DIR/pos/lexicon-rules-utilities/upcase-replibrill-lex* (several files)	$PP_SCRIPTS_DIR/pos/lexicon-rules-utilities/numeric-upcase-replibrill-lex* (several files)	$PP_SCRIPTS_DIR/pos/lexicon-rules-utilities/upcase-replibrill.train.scrubbed+quotes</pre><p>      NOTE ON 4.1.3 INSTALLATIONS: We currently do not have a license that      allows us to distribute 4.1.3 runtime Franz Allegro Common Lisp      images.  This disables a number of the Workbench utilities (found      under the Utilities menu).  If your site has its own license for      Allegro CL 4.2 or 4.3 on 4.1.3 machines, then contact us and we will      probably be able to provide you with a version of the image that      can run under 4.1.3 using your installed Allegro CL.<p>      NOTE ON MANUAL: A very useful manual has been included in this      distribution in the directory $AWB_REL_DIR/manual/.  These files      are HTML-encoded hyper-text.  If you point your web browser at      $AWB_REL_DIR/manual/index.html, all of the subsequent hyper links      are self contained (that is, within this same directory).</menu><p> Please feel free to contact any of the following people if you haveproblems or questions regarding the Alembic Workbench.<menu><li> Dr. David Day         (617) 271-2854   day@mitre.org<li> Ms. Patty Robinson    (617) 271-2849   par@mitre.org<li> Mr. John Aberdeen     (617) 271-2840   aberdeen@mitre.org<li> Dr. Lynette Hirschman (617) 271-7789   lynette@mitre.org</menu><p> U.S. Mail for any of the above:<pre>                       M.S.
