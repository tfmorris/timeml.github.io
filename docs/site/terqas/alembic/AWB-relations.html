Itis fully customizable by the user to adapt to new tasks.  Therelations file is analogous to the preferences file that is requiredfor entity tagging tasks.  In the same way that the preferences fileis consulted to generate actual SGML annotations, the relations filecreates templates, as well as enriched SGML annotations.  The SGMLannotations contain information about the way in which some templateentries are "related"; this information is recorded in the tags,themselves.  Notice that both the template and the tags are saved inthe SGML-encoded file.  <p><h4>To set up a relations file from theUnix command line:</h4></p>Copy a relations file from $AWB/relations directory into theappropriate directory.  For example, at the command-line, type:	<pre>cp $AWB/relations/exec-transition.rel $HOME/my-awb-relations.rel</pre>Edit the relations file accordingly. <br><br>You may wish to simply define a soft link to an appropriate file thatresides in the $AWB/relations directory.  This can be done in thefollowing way:	<pre>ln -s $AWB/relations/exec-transition.rel $HOME/my-awb-relations.rel</pre><strong><a name="notabene">The relations file indicates:</a></strong><br><UL><li>the name of the relation being tagged <li>the names of the objects being tagged<li>the method by which the objects are annotated<li>the colors to use to display each object being tagged</UL><a href=AWB-example-relations.html>Click here to view an example relations file.</a><br><br><strong>The relations file consists of multiple lines:</strong><pre>Relation-name: <em>RelationName</em><em>Object1</em> Annotation <em>foreground background</em><em>Object2</em> Annotation <em>foreground background</em><em>Object3</em> Annotation <em>foreground background</em></pre>Each relation must be defined in its own file.

In thefuture, the user may opt to select from a list of pre-defined values aparticular value for an object. <br><br>The foreground and background colors are used to colorize theannotated text.  Use any X colors or r-g-b specifications to designatecolors.<br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-how-to-tag-relations.html>11.
