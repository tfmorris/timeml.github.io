In any of values thatcause the user to be queried, the user may abort the creation of thetag by hitting either the backspace or the delete key.<menu><li> <strong>attribute="#"</strong> or     <strong>attribute="_GenerateUniqueInteger_"</strong> <br> If a     tag preference entry has an attribute with one of these specified     as its value, then every tag (element) instance generated     interactively by the user will have this attribute value set to a     unique integer.  (Note that this is used to specify ID values in     the special purpose COREF encodings generated by the Workbench.)<li> <strong>attribute="@"</strong> or     <strong>attribute="_ExtractTextFromTag_"</strong> <br> An     attribute value specified as this will cause the workbench to     query the user to click on some tag somewhere in the document;     then the text <strong>contents</strong> of this other tag will be     used to fill the value of this attribute.  (Note that this can be     useful in specifying MIN attribute values for COREF tags.)<li> <strong>attribute="&"</strong> or     <strong>attribute="_ExtractTextFromThisTag_"</strong> <br> This     is similar to the previous attribute value processing, except     that it defaults to picking the contents of the     <strong>current</strong> tag (the one being created) to be the     value of the specified attribute.<li> <strong>attribute="!"</strong> or     <strong>attribute="_ExtractTextFromSelection_"</strong> <br>     This, too, is similar to the "@" or "_ExtractTextFromTag_"     attribute value above, except that instead of requiring that a     tag already exist, it allows the user to create a tag "on the     fly" from which to extract the needed text. (Note that this can     be useful in specifying MIN attribute values for COREF tags.)<li> <strong>attribute="^"</strong> or     <strong>attribute="_ExtractIDfromCOREF_"</strong> <br> This is a     very special purpose attribute value that fills the value of an     attribute with the value extracted from the ID attribute of     another COREF tag, clicked on interactively by the user.<li> <strong>attribute="~"</strong> or     <strong>attribute="_MakeCOREFandExtractID_"</strong> <br> Another     COREF-specific attribute value that allows one to specify the     extent of a coreferential expression that has not yet been tagged     with a "COREF ID=\"#\"" tag.  The user is queried to select the     text to define the boundary of the initial mention expression,     and then both the current COREF REF= tag is created, along with a     COREF tag for the initial mention.<li> <strong>attribute="%"</strong> or     <strong>attribute="_TypeInText_"</strong> <br> Creating a tag     with this as one of the values of its attributes causes the     Workbench to query the user for an arbitrary string to be     included as the value of the specified attribute.<li> Other specialized attribute-specification mechanisms are planned     for the future.<br><br>NEXT: <a href=AWB-tagsetdef.html>7.Editing the Tagset Definition File</a> <br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-prefs.html>6.
