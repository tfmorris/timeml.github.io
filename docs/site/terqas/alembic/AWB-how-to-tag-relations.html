The user selects the text to be tagged, and then "copies" the selection into the template.<br><br>Use mouse button 1 to select the text to be tagged.  The text is temporarily highlighted in the color of the current tag (as shown in the tag menu).  Do not "apply" the tag to the text; <strong>it should only be selected</strong>.<br><br>Use mouse button 2 to copy the selected text into the appropriate field in the template.  Notice that the highlighting is now updated.  The tagged text is now colorized according to its tag (<em>i.e.</em>, field in the template).<br><br>No deleting of entries in the template supported yet.  This will soon change!<br><br>NEXT: <a href=AWB-bugs.html>12.
