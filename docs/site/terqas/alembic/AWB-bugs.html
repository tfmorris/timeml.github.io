Limitations and Bugs</h3>The Alembic Workbench is currently undergoing development and is thussusceptible to bugs.  If while using the Alembic Workbench anyundocumented features are observed, please contact David Day, <ahref="mailto:day@MITRE.ORG">day@mitre.org</a>, Principal Investigator.<br><br>Some of the limitations include:<br><br><UL><li>Files created by the Alembic Workbench should be left in thedirectory in which they are created.  For each file tagged in theinterface, there is a central document description file that containspointers to associated tag files, etc.  If a tag file is moved, the pointersin the document description file will no longer be valid, unlessmanually updated to reflect the new location of the file.<li>Possibility for overlap between Alembic Workbench mouse bindings (<a href="AWB-tagging.html#Table1">see Table 1</a>) and those specified by the user's window manager.</UL><br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-content.html>Alembic Workbench User's Guide Table of Contents</a><br></body></html>
