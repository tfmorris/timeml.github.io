Tagging File for Entities</h3></OL><h4>Annotating versus Editing Data Files</h4>Once a file is opened, it can beannotated; the user can add, delete, or manipulate the boundaries ofmarkup.  (Exception: markup that is write-protected cannot be edited.)The raw text itself, however, is protected against changes and cannotbe modified.  Editing, therefore, should be completed off-line. <br><br><h4>Adding Tags</h4>In order to apply a tag to text, the text must be selected.  Selected text is highlighted in the color of the current tag.  When a tag is applied to the selected text, the text itself is shown in the foreground color of the current tag, and remains highlighted in the background color. The user will notice in the tag line (at the bottom of the tool) the name of the tag that was applied.  Note that the tool allows the addition of embedded and coextensive tags.  For the case of a text string with nested tags, the tag is simply added to the lexeme selected by the user.  For example,<pre>&ltNUMEX TYPE=MONEY&gt&ltENAMEX TYPE=LOCATION&gtUS&lt/ENAMEX&gt $10 million&lt/NUMEX&gt</pre>For text tagged with coextensive tags, the text is highlighted in the most recently added tag.  However, when the file is saved out in an SGML-encoded file, the tagset definition is consulted to determine the priority (position) of the new tag. <br><br>To change the current tag, click on the Tag menu and select a new tag.  The current tag will reflect the chosen one, and any selected text will be highlighted in the color of the new current tag. Alternately, use the keyboard accelerator, e.g. press Control-l to change the current tag Name to Location, specified in the .awb-prefs file.  Both of these methods can be applied to already selected text, changing the selection to the new current tag.<br><br><h4>Deleting and Changing Boundaries of Tags</h4>To delete a tag from text, the text should be selected by pressingControl-Shift mouse button 1, followed by either the Delete or BackSpacekey.  Once the tag is deleted, the colored highlighting disappears.  The boundaries of already-existing tags can be extended orshortened by similarly selecting the highlighted text, and thenpressing the appropriate combination of Meta-mouse button to changethe boundaries of the selection.<br><br>When there are coextensive tags, the text will be displayed in the color of the outermost tag.  For example, in the case of:<pre>&ltENAMEX TYPE=PERSON&gt&ltLEX TYPE=NNP&gtClinton&lt/LEX&gt&lt/ENAMEX&gt</pre>Clinton will be highlighted in the color designated for PERSON tags.<br><br>To delete any underlying tags, locate the cursor on the highlighted text and press tab.  Delete accordingly.<br><br><table border><caption><strong>Table 1: Mouse Bindings</strong></caption><TR><TH>Mouse Binding</TH><TH>Abbreviation</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR><TR><td>mouse button 1</td><td>&ltB1&gt</td><td>To select a word or to extend selection left</td></tr><tr><td>mouse button 2</td><td>&ltB2&gt</td><td>To tag selection with current tag</td></tr><tr><td>mouse button 3 </td><td>&ltB3&gt</td><td> To select a word or extend selection right</td></tr><tr><td>mouse button 1 and drag </td><td>&ltDrag-B1&gt</td><td> Drag out an exact selection</td></tr><tr><td>Shift-button 1 </td><td>&ltS-B1&gt</td><td> Extend selection to here </td></tr><tr><td>Meta-button 1 </td><td>&ltM-B1&gt</td><td> Shorten selection left</td></tr><tr><td>Control-Shift button 1 </td><td>&ltC-S-B1&gt</td><td>Select a tag to change or delete</td></tr><tr><td>Tab</td><td></td><td>To "sift" through coextensive tags</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Shift-button-2</td><td>&ltS-button-1&gt</td><td>To override Auto Tag's auto mode</td></tr></table border><br><strong>Note:</strong> The Esc key can be used as an alternative to the Meta key.<!-- (for PAR: reference double click on B1 or B3 to select and tagand scroll)--> <br><br>NEXT: <a href=AWB-coreference.html>10.
