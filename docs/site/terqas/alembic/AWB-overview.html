The "Alembic" project at MITRE has developed asubstantial initial capability towards constructing an effective IEsystem that has demonstrated impressive performance levels at the mostrecent Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) and the MultilingualEntity Task evaluation organized as part of the May, 1996 TIPSTERconference.  The Alembic system, like others, makes use of specializedheuristics that recognize and extract the relevant facts from texts.What is different and important about the Alembic system is itsability to mix hand-coded heuristic rules with machine-learnedheuristic rules.  The Alembic Workbench project is developing aninformation extraction porting environment in which the training datathat drive this learning process are generated quickly by amixed-initiative annotation process involving a human user and themachine learning mechanism itself.  This project aims to construct anenvironment in which the human can have his or her knowledge of thedomain transferred quickly and effectively into the form of trainingdata and extraction heuristics by the cooperative activity of machinelearning and evaluative feedback to the user.<p>Portability remains a major problem for information extractionsystems.  It takes multiple person months for the best IE systems tobe modified and customized for a new domain.  This process mustinclude the creation of annotated training and test materials tosupport the development and refinement of the IE system.  Theobjective of the Alembic Workbench project is to reduce the amount oftime to customize an IE system for a new domain to a matter of days.Many of today's systems are becoming not only more easily adaptable tosupport this process, but automatically (self-) adaptive using machinelearning techniques.  However, there is an important ingredient thatstill requires a human in the loop: adaptive/adaptable systems requiretraining and test data against which to measure and improve theirperformance.  The knowledge engineering bottleneck is beingtransformed to an ever larger degree into a training data acquisitionbottleneck.  Our approach is to use an iterative boot-strappingprocedure interleaving human annotation and machine learning early onin the process of generating training and testing data.  By usingpartially accurate rules to automatically annotate new text, webelieve that the process of human data preparation can be simplifiedand streamlined to one of review and editing.  In addition, the rulesgenerated can themselves be scrutinized and improved by the annotatorto further quicken the pace of performance improvement.  In fact, theprocess of creating and reviewing the training data turns out to bethe same process by which the information extraction heuristics aredefined and refined.  High-quality annotated text and high-qualityinformation extraction heuristics are developed simultaneously.<p><b>Approach</b><p>Our intent is to develop an environment in which there is synergyamong the following activities:<menu><li> Manual annotation of text, <li> Manual composition of information extraction heuristics (in       the form of "phrase finding rule sequences" in the parlance       of Alembic),<li> Automatic induction of information extraction rules via the       machine learning component,<li> Evaluation of the system's performance.</menu><p>All four of these components will be equipped with an API toenhance the value of the components to other systems.  The textannotation component will be carefully designed to optimize the easewith which text can be tagged with different kinds of markup.  The APIfor this component comes in the form of a TIPSTER-compliant documentrepresentation, in which parallel sets of annotation files aremaintained separately from a source text file that is never modifieddirectly.  Further, this API will support the parsing and generationof SGML-formatted documents for representing this same annotation set.The rule sequence module may be invoked from external tools, and maybe applied either to the parallel tag file format used by thetailoring environment, or any SGML document.  The machine learningmechanism for inducing new rule sequences will eventually also beequipped with an API that will allow it to be applied to SGML trainingcorpora developed independently of the tailoring tool.  The evaluationand performance reporting tools built for use within the GUI will alsobe callable from external tools.<p><b>Status</b><p>To date, after four months of work, we have an initial workbenchcapability.  This is now being used to annotate close-captioned textfrom video.  We are also using the Alembic Workbench to performnamed-entity tagging (people, organizations, locations) for Portuguesenews texts.  Early indications are quite positive.  In the case ofnamed-entity tagging, an amount of training text equal to thatprovided to participants in MUC-6 (approximately 35,000 words, with3,500 tagged entities) has been annotated in 6-7 hours of effort overa period of a week.  We intend to begin a careful evaluation of theefficiency of the tool in the near future.<p><b>Future Directions</b><p>While Alembic Workbench project is still in its early stages, we canalready see directions in which we would like to further enhance thissuite of synergistic language processing tools.  A developing focusfor Alembic is the rapid development of all of its modules(pre-processing, part-of-speech tagging, phrase-tagging, parsing) tomany different languages.  Not only is this an important interest forintelligence agencies, it also allows us to concentrate ourdevelopment on empirical methods for the development of languageprocessing capability. Below are some of the ways in which theworkbench could be enhanced to better support this multi-lingualemphasis.<menu><li> Adopt a general mechanism for handling the display and processing     of non-latin fonts (probably using uni-code, but not     exclusively).<li> Enhance the pattern and phrase-finding rule language to enable     specification of non-latin character set elements.<li> Expand the existing facilities for capturing, displaying and     analyzing coreference phenomena.<li> Increase the support for capturing, displaying and analyzing     event level information in the text (e.g., the so-called     "template entity" and "scenario template" information extracted     within the MUC evaluations).<li> Support the indexing and integrated display of any existing or     emerging commentary on a particular annotation task.<li> Port of the Workbench to platforms other than Sun workstations.</menu><p><font size=2 color="#003399"></font><td width="10%"></table>NEXT: <a href=AWB-readme-and-install.html>3.
