COREF is the SGML Generic Identifier (GI) for the tag.  The { * ID="#"} specifies the ID attribute, and will create a tag with only an ID attribute.  However, the wildcard * will match those tags that have an additional attribute, <em>e.g.</em>, TYPE="IDENT", along with the ID attribute for display purposes.    The wildcard will not appear in the actual SGML tag.  This tag is used to annotate those base expressions that do not need a MINIMUM attribute.  The Workbench interprets the pound sign at tagging time and replaces it with a uniquely assigned number enclosed in quotes.  The The empty angle brackets ({}) mean that the tag will be shown in the tag line, and will not be abbreviated. The text will be highlighted in the foreground color black and background color darkseagreen.  The 1 instructs the Workbench that the tag should appear in the tag menu. Meta-r is the keyboard accelerator for this tag.<br><br>The second line instructs the Workbench to create a base expression tag.  COREF is the SGML Generic Identifier (GI) for the tag.  The { * ID="#" MIN="@" } specifies the ID and MIN attributes and creates tags with those attributes.  As in the above example, it also displays those tags that have an additional attribute.  The Workbench interprets the pound sign at tagging time and replaces it with a uniquely assigned number enclosed in quotes.  The @ sign instructs the Workbench to prompt the user for the "value" of the MIN attribute; the @ sign is replaced with the value, <em>i.e.</em>, a text string, and is enclosed in quotes. The empty angle brackets ({}) mean that the tag will be shown in the tag line, and will not be abbreviated. The text will be highlighted in the foreground color black and background color darkseagreen.  The 1 instructs the Workbench that the tag should appear in the tag menu. Meta-R is the keyboard accelerator for this tag.<br><br>The third line instructs the Workbench to create an referring expression tag with only ID and REF attributes.  Notice that the wildcard * will also match a third attribute, and will display tags with ID, REF, and a miscellaneous third attribute.  However, it will not create tags with a third attribute.  The Workbench interprets the pound sign at tagging time and replaces it with the correct, unique number value.  The Workbench also interprets the carot sign at tagging time, and replaces it with the ID number of the base expression to which the user "connects" it.  The quotes mean that the tag will be shown in the tag line, and will not be abbreviated. The text will be highlighted in the foreground color blue and background color green.  The 1 instructs the Workbench that the tag should appear in the tag menu.  Meta-C is the keyboard accelerator for this tag. <br><br>The fourth line instructs the Workbench to create an anaphor/referring expression tag with ID, REF, and MIN attributes.  The pound sign will be replaced with a uniquely assigned number, the carot sign with a number referring to the base expression, the @ sign with the appropriate minimal text string.  The wildcard * will be used to match a fourth attribute, but will disappear when the actual SGML annotation for this tag is created.   The text will be highlighted in the foreground color blue and background color green.  The 1 instructs the Workbench that the tag should appear in the tag menu.  Meta-C is the keyboard accelerator for this tag. <br><br>The fifth line instructs the Workbench to create a tag with MIN as the SGML Generic Identifier. The {} signifies that this tag does not have attributes.  It will appear in the tag menu and tag line as &ltMinimum&gt. The text will be highlighted in the foreground color lightskyblue and background color paleTurquoise.  The 1 instructs the Workbench that the tag should appear in the tag menu.  Meta-M is the keyboard accelerator for this tag.  <br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-example-coreference.html>10.1 Preferences for Simple Coreference Tagging</a><br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-coreference.html>10.
