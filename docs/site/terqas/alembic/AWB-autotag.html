The user has a choice of four modes, and should set the mode according to his preferences for aided tagging.<br><br><strong>Off mode:</strong><br>Offers no assistance to the user.  This is the Alembic Workbench's default mode.<br><br><strong>Query mode:</strong><br>Queries the user to determine whether to apply tag to each subsequent occurrence of a phrase previously tagged.  User decides whether to simply add an annotation to the phrase or replace existing annotations.<br><br><strong>Auto mode:</strong><br>Globally adds tags to all occurrences of phrase tagged by user.  Nofeedback is given.  To selectively override auto mode when tagging a phrase, press the key sequence Shift-mouse-button 2.<br><br><strong>Auto-Confirm mode:</strong><br>Informs user whether subsequent occurrences of phrase have been found and confirms whether to tag all other instances globally.<br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-options.html>5.3 The Options Menu</a><br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-content.html>Alembic Workbench User's Guide Table of Contents</a></body></html>
