The search utility also includes a Tag Selection option from which the user can choose to add tags to those text strings found in the document.<br><br>5.42 & 5.43<strong>Score files...</strong><br>The <a href=AWB-score.html>AWB scorer</a> and <a href=AWB-muc-score.html>MUC scorer</a> are accessed through this cascaded menu.  The MUC scorer is the standard scoring utility provided to participants of the Sixth Message Understanding Conference.  The AWB scorer is the Alembic Workbench's own scoring routine.  Similar to the MUC scorer, it compares the markup found in two files, <em>i.e.</em>, a key and test file, and generates a score report based on the comparison.  In addition, the AWB scorer has an added feature that enables the user to selectively score "phrases," rather than entire documents.  Scores are measured in terms of precision and recall, where the more closely the response matches the key, the higher the score.  Thus, a file scored against itself should yield a 100% precision/100% recall score.<br><br>5.44<a href=AWB-process.html>Process Text...</a><br>This utility allows the user to process text files with the Alembic natural language processing system.  Depending on the preferences of the user, the text can be automatically annotated with part-of-speech and Named Entity style annotations.<br><br>5.45<a href=AWB-learnrules.html>Learn Alembic Phrase Finding Rules...</a>This utility provides the user with an interface for the Alembic Workbench to learn rules that would otherwise be learned through background procedures.<br><br>5.46<a href=AWB-erroranal.html>Perform Error Analysis of Rules...</a><br>This utility allows the user to apply a specified rule file to a text file for which a key file is available.  Once the rules have been applied and a response file is generated, the key and response files are compared.  An error analysis report is created based on the comparison.<br><br>5.47<a href=AWB-extract.html>Extract Phrases...</a><br>This utility enables the user to selectively filter phrases from an SGML-encoded file.  The user can elect to save the extracted phrases for later review in a text editor.  Note that the term phrases is used to denote annotations.<br><br>5.48<a href=AWB-compare.html>Compare Alternate Annotation...</a><br>This utility allows the user to visually compare two files that differ only in terms of markup.  Differences in annotations are marked by underline.<br><br>5.49<a href=AWB-segmenttag.html>Segmentation Tagger...</a>This utility provides the user with an interface to correct, change, or add segmentation tags.<br><br>NEXT: <a href=AWB-help.html>5.5 The HELP Menu</a><br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-interface.html>5.
