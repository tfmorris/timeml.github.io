The itemsin each entry are positional. Therefore, if you are creating a newpreferences file with a text editor, take care not to omit any itemsuntil you finish specifying all of the previous, pertinentones. <br><br>The <strong>Tag Type</strong> is the SGML Generic Identifier.  Forexample, ENAMEX is the Tag Type in &ltENAMEX TYPE=PERSON&gt. <br><br>To view or create tags that contain quote characters, <em>e.g.</em>,ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON", the quotes must be included and escaped with aslash. <br><br>The <strong>Attributes</strong> can be replaced by * if you want anytag with that basic Tag Type to behave as indicated, or can contain a* if you want to specify a necessary subset of the attributes.<strong>Note:</strong> If you use a wildcard, note that when<strong>adding</strong> a new element of that type, the element willonly contain specifically described attributes, and the asterisk will beignored.  Use {} as your list of attributes if you want to specify atag with just a base Tag Type (just a Generic Identifier) and noattributes.  Note that end Generic Identifier tags, <em>i.e.</em>,&lt/Tag Type&gt, are never explicitly specified in the preferencesfile.  Instead, they are automatically created in the form &lt/TagType&gt by the Workbench.To display a tag in abbreviated form in the tag line (or "mouseline"), specify an abbreviation.  Abbreviations are used only fordisplay purposes, and are not consulted when creating tags forSGML-encoded files. <br><br>Specify <strong>Foreground</strong> and <strong>Background</strong> colors to view the tag in those colors.  All tags will be shown on the tagline,regardless of whether color preferences are specified.  Use any Xcolors or r-g-b specifications to designate colors in your preferencesfile. <br><br>Set <strong>Editable?</strong> to 1 (Yes) to include the tag in the menu.  Setting it to 0 (No) or not setting it omits it from the tag menu.  The user is able to annotate only with tags that are displayed in the tagmenu. <br><br>Specify an <strong>Accelerator</strong> to enable you to choose from thekeyboard a new current tag.  A keyboard accelerator is a letter,Control-letter, or Meta-letter combination enclosed in angle brackets.  Forexample,&ltn&gt, &ltControl-n&gt, and &ltMeta-n&gt are all validkeyboard accelerator specifications. <br><br>Specify an abbreviation for the <strong>MenuAbbrev.</strong> entry as the seventh item on the line.  This allows one to hide some of the markup details from the user, and provide more intuitive entries in the tag pull-down menu.<br><br><a href=AWB-eg-prefs.html>Click here to view example .awb-prefsfiles.</a><br><br>NEXT: <a href=AWB-special-prefs.html>6.4 Special Attribute Values</a><br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-prefs.html>6.
