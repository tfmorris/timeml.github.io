The four different modes, Off, Query, Auto, and Auto-Confirm, instruct the Alembic Workbench to apply annotations globally or restrictively, depending on the user's preferences for feedback.<br><br><strong>Language:</strong><br>Enables the user to inform the Alembic Workbench of the language in which to display.  Note that only Latin-1 languages, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and Greek are currently supported.  In order to run languages such as Japanese and Chinese, which are character based, the Alembic Workbench must be set up for JIS which can be done either at the time of start-up or by creating a New Workbench Viewer under <a href=AWB-file.html>File</a>.<br><br><strong>Coreference:</strong><br>Makes available the options Show Coreference Targets, Highlight Coreference Chain, Remove "highlighting" of Coreference Chain, "Hide" Coreference Chains, and Restore "Hidden" Coreference Chains.  Show Coreference Targets launches a scrolling list box that contains all strings denoted by the user as coreference referents.  The option Highlight Coreference Chain allows the user to selectively highlight one chain of coreference. Remove "highlighting" of Coreference Chain removes the highlighting from the chain. "Hide" Coreference Chains hides chains selected by the user which can be restored with the Restore "Hidden" Coreference Chains option.  The Tag Set File must be set for Coreference to use these options.<br><br><strong>File Loading Options...</strong>Allows the user to decide whether or not the tool should check for overlapping annotation when loading a document.<br><br><strong>File Saving Options...</strong>Gives the user options about the SGML annotation for attributes.<br><br><strong>Tag Preferences</strong><br>Provides the user with a Graphical User Interface from which to create new tag preferences, load previously generated preferences, edit existing preferences, and apply the desired preferences to the current tag menu.For more information regarding Editing and Loading Tag Preferences <a href=AWB-edit-prefs.html>Click here to go to Chapter 6.
