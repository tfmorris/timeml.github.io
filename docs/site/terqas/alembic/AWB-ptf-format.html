As a step in this conversion, any markup found in the file is<a href=AWB-normalize.html>normalized</a>, <em>i.e.</em>, tested for compliance with the Document Type Definition (DTD) selected by the user.  If non-compliant SGML markup is encountered, an informative error dialog is launched to apprise the user of any anomalies found.  If the user elects to ignore the error message, the conversion process can be continued. The file is then converted toParallel Tag File Format (PTF), which creates a document description file(denoted with the extension .dd) and distinct files (denoted with theextension .tag) that contain explicit markup data in the directory inwhich &ltfilename&gt is located:<br><br><OL><li>&ltfilename&gt.norm<li>&ltfilename&gt.norm.txt<li>&ltfilename&gt.norm.dd<li>zero or more &ltfilename&gt.norm.&ltannotation-type&gt.tag    files</OL><br><table border><caption><strong>Table 2: File Extensions Created by PTF Conversion</strong></caption><TR><TH>File Extension</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR><TR><td>.norm</td><td>The product of the normalization and pre-processing routines.This file contains normalized markup and optionally, text that hasbeen converted according to pre-processing options selected by the user.</td></tr><TR><td>.norm.txt</td><td>The .norm file that has been stripped of markup.</td></tr><TR><td>.dd</td><td>The document description file</td></tr><TR><td><var>annotation-type</var>.tag</td><td>The annotation file in which explicit tag data is stored separate from text text.</td></tr></table><br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-open-close.html>5.11 Opening Raw Text Files</a><br><br>Return to <a href=AWB-openSGML.html>5.12.
