<P>During the 1990's, the field of computational linguistics achievedseveral practical advances through the construction of annotatedcorpora for developing and testing various technologies. This documentdescribes an initial set of guidelines for annotating time expressionswith a canonicalized representation of the times they refer to. Thiswork has been carried out in support of a number of researchactivities under DARPA's Translingual Information Detection,Extraction, and Summarization (TIDES) research research. The researchwhich can most directly benefit includes question answering (e.g.,answering "when" questions), event characterization and tracking,visualization of events on timelines, and production of biographicalsummaries. Other research related to information extraction may alsobenefit.</P><p>This is a draft document, which is expected to undergo considerablerevision based on feedback from other researchers, before it isofficially published and before any large-scale annotation efforts areinitiated. The guidelines specify more details of semanticrepresentation than the TIMEX recognition tasks used in recentDARPA-sponsored evaluations (MUC7 1998), but are similar in that theytreat the temporal expressions as stand-alone targets forannotation/extraction. These guidelines are intended to support avariety of downstream applications in the performance of some usefultasks; they are not intended to represent all the varieties oftemporal information conveyed in natural language communication (thelatter is a hopelessly ambitious goal, in our view). The guidelinesare aimed at two sets of users:</P><P>1. Human annotators about to embark on the annotation of temporalexpressions in order to construct corpora consisting of temporallyannotated data for use by the NL community.</P><P>2. System developers who are building tagging programs to extracttemporal information from documents.</P>
