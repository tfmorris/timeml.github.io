<P>RDC records certain types of reported associations between pairs ofentities. It also requires the reporting of the relation timestamps,i.e. of the time when a relation is reported as existing. For thefirst round of RDC, we take a conservative approach to associatingtimes with relations, and require that the text evidence be foundwithin the predication of a relation mention. Thus, we treat onlyClass A (explicit) relations, and only those that include explicittemporal evidence. </P><P>The text evidence of a timestamp may be in the form of a temporalphrase that is an adjunct to the predicate ("Bush's Saturday visit toManhattan", "Rumsfeld became U.S. Secretary of Defense again in2001"). A more general timestamp may be present in the form of afinite verb that heads the predication of the relation. A largeproportion of Class A relation mentions will contain neither a timeadjunct phrase nor a finite verb, and will therefore be assigned nulltemporal attribute values. </P><P>There may be more than one time at which a particular relationship isreported as having existed, i.e., there may be more than one timestampon a relation. For example, a document may note that John Doe wasLOCATED at Las Vegas June and August in 2001, or that Jane Doe had theROLE of Technical Director for SPAWAR Systems Center in 1998 and2000. The two different times referenced in each example are notevidence of different underlying relations; they are differentattribute values for the same underlying relation.</P>
