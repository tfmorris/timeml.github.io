Temporal relations aren&#146;t marked here,either.</P><P>The current task isn&#146;t the categorization of time adverbials butassigning values to expressions. The manual annotation is thought to guidethe training of the future computer annotation task.</P><P>The representation is an extension of ISSO standard on temporal markup.The basic notation is in terms of points. Among other issues, TIDES covers:duration, week values, imprecise temporal expressions (summer, etc.),truncation and other forms of imprecision.</P></FONT><B><P>Issues arisen from this discussion (and from the evaluation ofthe tagset): </B> </P><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3><UL></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><LI>Concerning what info do we want to annotate:</B><P>Further topics that can be explored, not handled in TIDES:</P><UL><LI>Embedded or complex expressions (e.g., <I>from Monday to Wednesday)</LI></I><LI>Sets of durations (<I>last three months</I>)</LI><LI>Holidays </LI><LI>Time zones; culture-related Time Expressions</LI><LI>Temporal displacements (<I>the President met his wife &#133;</I>)</LI><LI>Ambiguity (there is no way to encode it now); how to representambiguous time stamps.</LI><LI>Anaphora related topics </LI><LI>Co-reference </LI><LI>Relations among events</LI><LI>&#133;</LI></UL><P>Essentially, there are 2 directions to take given TIDES as startingpoint:</P><OL TYPE="a"><B><LI>Binding</B>, related to anaphora,</LI><B><LI>Recognizing events</B>, which requires having an ontology, the useof morphology, the knowledge already available about regular polysemy,clustering of events, modality, scalar increasing/decreasing, etc.</LI></OL></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=3></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P>It has to be agreement on:</P><UL><LI>the level of granularity of the annotation.</LI><LI>the complexity of the resolution of anaphora.</LI><LI>what kind of events do we want to identify; patterns of events</LI><LI>how much put in the tags</LI><LI>&#133;</LI></UL><P>Certain expressions should be characterized by presenting scaled (orfuzzy) borders (e.g., <I>century</I> meaning approx. 100 years).</P><P>Polysemy of temporal expressions should be coded in the marking up.Prior to this, it has to be an identification of the different types ofambiguity; e.g., <I>next Monday</I> (either one or the otherinterpretation), <I>last year </I>(vague), <I>fifth anniversary</I> (event&#151; temporal expression).</P><P>It could be interesting to give a measure of the confidence of themarkup as part of the notation (currently there is only a&quot;comments&quot; field). This would allow knowing the rate of possibleerror accumulation.</P><P>On the use of context in the annotation process: </P><P>It&#146;s still not clear to what level and for what particular purposesto use the context. It may be interesting to contemplate different levelsof information according to their origin: just from the temporalexpression, from the phrase in which it appears (e.g., including info fromprepositions), from the aspectuality of the event, from an upper-sentencelevel, from the temporal info of the document (e.g., issuing date). Inaddition, the annotation should keep track of the level from which the infois obtained.</P><P>Similarly, it may be interesting to define different levels of&quot;windows&quot; for anaphora resolution and, as above, to keep track ofit.</P><P>It would be useful to have a diary collecting problems arisen from themarking up (Beth. Lisa). Beth said she has a laundry list of items thatshould be incorporated into the standards.  For example: &quot;he lastthree summers.&quot; It's a set type annotation but it is also a durationannotation.  Everyone said they would like to see Beth's laundry list.  </P><P>It was asked how long does it take to train an annotator. How fast doesit take to annotate an article.  The workshop would like to bring insomeone to do the annotating. George Wilson mentioned that Inderjeet hadsix grad students from Georgetown annotating documents. They had two 3-hourtraining sessions. The result was an F score of about .8.  The articleswere about 1000 words and it took about 3/4 hour to tag.</P></FONT><P>Single events and multiple events: there is a corpus from NIST.Could be useful.</P><FONT SIZE=3><P>Remarks and comments:</P><P>Suggestion:  Pick some functions and talk about time as floating pointnumber.
