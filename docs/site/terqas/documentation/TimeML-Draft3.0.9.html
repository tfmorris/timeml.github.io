Thisrevision specifies the syntax of TimeML, i.e. essentially its tags andtheir attributes, with examples illustrating their basic use.  Since thepure syntax of TimeML will often leave open how a particular phenomenonshould be annotated (e.g. should modals in English be marked up asSIGNALs or EVENTs), this document leaves a number of issuesunderspecified.  Fuller discussion of the conventions by which TimeMLshould be applied can be found in the accompanying annotation guidelines(Pustejovsky, et al. (2002)).<p>The document begins with the &#147;leaf nodes&#148; of TimeML: the tagsthat include texts that describe the basic temporal elements within adocument.  The next section introduces SIGNAL, the tag that wrapsexpressions that specify how temporal elements should be related.  Thethird section deals with links, empty tags that explicitly annotate thetemporal relations either marked by signals or indicated purelysyntactically,  The next section deals with miscellaneous other tags. The last section deals with open questions.<h3>Naming Conventions</h3><p>Inasmuch as XML is case-sensitive, it is necessary for TimeML to specifyexactly the case of all its elements.  This document follows theconvention of indicating tag names and attribute values in all uppercase (e.g. EVENT, PROGRESSIVE) and attribute names in lower or mixedcase (e.g. tense, relatedToTime).  Since attribute values are typicallyatomic (one-word) while attribute names often consist of multiple words,this convention would seem to maximize readability of the annotation. (Multi-word attribute values use the underscore character to separatetheir component parts.)<p>This document also follows the attribute naming convention introduced inSetzer (2001).  Attributes that range over values of XML datatype ID---aunique index---are short, consisting of one or two characters indicatingthe name of the element, followed by &#145;id&#146; (e.g. tid, eiid). Attributes that range over values of XML datatype IDREF---references toIDs---typically consist of the name of the element indexed, followed by&#145;ID&#146; (e.g. eventID) or a descriptive name (e.g.relatedToTime).<p>The values of the various ID attributes are specified as beginning withone or two characters, followed by an integer.  This scheme is mandatedby the syntax of XML.  While attribute values of type ID can consist ofany sequence of letters, digits, and the hyphen, underscore, and periodcharacters, they must begin with either an underscore or a letter. Therefore <tt>"e23"</tt> is a valid XML ID; but <tt>"23"</tt> is not. This naming convention also helps make the examples a bit more readable,especially in the case of link tags, which can contain multiple IDREFsof different kinds.<p>Finally, in the descriptions of the values of attributes, where XML DTDand XML schema definitions would differ, the schema definition isindicated between {}.<h3>The Examples</h3><p>Though this document describes the full TimeML language, many of theexample annotations provided show the result of annotation only throughthe output of initial automatic tagging combined with humanannotation/editing, but do not include elements (e.g. attributes and/orattribute vaues) that may be introduced by later processing components(e.g. the closure tool).  In particular, TIMEX3 tags that are treated astemporal functions typically appear in the examples in an underspecifiedform.  However, those elements that do appear are sufficient for theoutput of manual annotation. <p>Finally, note that all examples in this document have been validatedagainst a TimeML DTD corresponding to the BNF given here, using theoXygen XML editor, version 1.1.<h2>2.0 Temporal Entities</h2><h3>&lt;EVENT&gt;</h3><p>The EVENT tag is used to annotate those elements in a text that mark thesemantic events described by it.  Syntactically, EVENTs are typicallyverbs, although event nominals, such as &#147;crash&#148; in&#147;...killed by the crash&#148;, will also be annotated as EVENTs.<p>The EVENT tag is also used to annotate a subset of the states in adocument.  This subset of states includes those that are eithertransient or explicitly marked as participating in a temporal relation. See the TimeML annotation guidelines for more details.<pre>attributes ::= eid class tense aspect eid ::= ID{eid ::= EventIDEventID ::= e&lt;integer&gt;}class ::= 'OCCURRENCE' | 'PERCEPTION' | 'REPORTING' | 'ASPECTUAL' | 'STATE' | 'I_STATE' | 'I_ACTION' | 'MODAL'tense ::= 'PAST' | 'PRESENT' | 'FUTURE' | 'NONE'aspect ::= 'PROGRESSIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE' | 'NONE'</pre><p>We expect that the <tt>tense</tt> and <tt>aspect</tt> attributes willhave their values filled in by a pre-processing program, according tothe following paradigm:<h3>Active Voice</h3><h3><tt>tense="PRESENT"</tt></h3><table><tr><th width="50%" align="left">Verb group</th><th align="left"><tt>aspect=</tt></th></tr><tr><td>teaches</td><td><tt>"NONE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>is teaching</td><td><tt>"PROGRESSIVE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>has taught</td><td><tt>"PERFECTIVE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>has been teaching</td><td><tt>"PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE"</tt></td></tr></table><h3><tt>tense="PAST"</tt></h3><table><tr><th width="50%" align="left">Verb group</th><th align="left"><tt>aspect=</tt></th></tr><tr><td>taught</td><td><tt>"NONE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>was teaching</td><td><tt>"PROGRESSIVE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>had taught</td><td><tt>"PERFECTIVE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>had been teaching</td><td><tt>"PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE"</tt></td></tr></table><h3><tt>tense="FUTURE"</tt></h3><table><tr><th width="50%" align="left">Verb group</th><th align="left"><tt>aspect=</tt></th></tr><tr><td>will teach</td><td><tt>"NONE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>will be teaching</td><td><tt>"PROGRESSIVE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>will have taught</td><td><tt>"PERFECTIVE"</tt></td></tr><tr><td>will have been teaching</td><td><tt>"PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE"</tt></td></tr></table><h3>Passive Voice</h3><p>Note: Forms marked with (?) do not seem fully acceptable.

(2002)) TIMEX2 tag.  Since itdiffers both in attribute structure and in use, it seemed best to giveit a separate name, which reveals its heritage while at the same timeindicating that it is different from its forebears.<pre>attributes ::= tid type [functionInDocument] [temporalFunction] (value | valueFromFunction) [mod] [anchorTimeID | anchorEventID]tid ::= ID{tid ::= TimeIDTimeID ::= t&lt;integer&gt;}type ::= 'DATE' | 'TIME' | 'DURATION'functionInDocument ::= 'CREATION_TIME' | 'EXPIRATION_TIME' | 'MODIFICATION_TIME' | 'PUBLICATION_TIME' |			'RELEASE_TIME'| 'RECEPTION_TIME' | 'NONE' {default, if absent, is 'NONE'} temporalFunction ::= 'true' | 'false' {default, if absent, is 'false'}{temporalFunction ::= boolean}value ::= CDATA{value ::= duration | dateTime | time | date | gYearMonth | gYear | gMonthDay | gDay | gMonth}valueFromFunction ::= IDREF{valueFromFunction ::= TemporalFunctionIDTemporalFunctionID ::= tf&lt;integer&gt;}mod ::= 'BEFORE' | 'AFTER' | 'ON_OR_BEFORE' | 'ON_OR_AFTER' | 'LESS_THAN' | 'MORE_THAN' |		'EQUAL_OR_LESS' | 'EQUAL_OR_MORE' | 'START' | 'MID' | 'END' | 'APPROX'anchorTimeID ::= IDREF{anchorTimeID ::= TimeID}anchorEventID ::= IDREF{anchorEventID ::= EventID}</pre><p><tt>functionInDocument</tt>, an optional attribute, indicates the functionof the TIMEX3 in providing a temporal anchor for other temporalexpressions in the document.  If this attribute is not explicitlysupplied, the default value is <tt>"NONE"</tt>.  The non-empty valuestake their names from the temporal metadata tags in the Prism draftstandard (available at <ahref="http://www.prismstandard.org/techdev/prismspec1.asp">http://www.prismstandard.org/techdev/prismspec1.asp</a>),and are intended to have the same interpretations:<blockquote>There are several times that mark the major milestones in the life of anews resource: The time the story is published, the time it may bereleased (if not immediately), the time it is received by a customer,and the time that the story expires (if any). Dates and times should berepresented using the W3C-defined profile of ISO 8601[W3C-NOTE-datetime].<pre>Table 4: Elements for Time and Date InformationElement                 Roleprism:creationTime      Date and time the identified resource was first created.prism:expirationTime    Date and time when the right to publish material expires.prism:modificationTime  Date and time the resource was last modified.prism:publicationTime   Date and time when the resource is released to the public.prism:releaseTime       Earliest date and time when the resource may be distributed.prism:receptionTime     Date and time when the resource was received on current system. </pre></blockquote><p>Note that there can be as many instances of TIMEX3s containing a<tt>functionInDocument</tt> attribute with a non-empty value as thereare TIMEX3s that express different functions.  In practive, there willprobably be no more than two, one with <tt>CREATION_TIME</tt> andanother with <tt>PUBLICATION_TIME</tt>, since these are likely to be theonly attributes that will appear in the text of documents to beannotated.  Note that <tt>RELEASE_TIME</tt> does not indicate when thedocument was actually released.  It is a specification of when thedocument is allowed to be released.  This comes up in documents that aresyndicated and where the issuing organization wants to delay publicationby syndicators, so as not to be scooped.<p>Note also that the Prism standard, at least in its temporal indicators,is interested only in the document as an artifact, a piece ofintellectual property.  This means that the Prism values do not indicatethe function of a TIMEX3 relative to the internal narrative of thedocument.  The specification of the TimeML language can fill this gap byadding values for the <tt>functionInDocument</tt> attribute that capturenarrative functions.  At present, we leave the specification of possiblevalues as is, and will defer the obvious extension until annotation ofexisting texts indicates that this is a pressing issue.<p><tt>temporalFunction</tt>, an optional attribute, indicates whether theTIMEX3 is used as a temporal function; e.g. &#147;two weeks ago&#148;. If this attribute is not explicitly supplied, the default value is<tt>"false"</tt>.  It is used in conjunction with<tt>anchorTimeID</tt>, which indicates the TIMEX3 to which itsdenotation is applied.  It also appears with <tt>valueFromFunction</tt>,a pointer to a temporal function that determines its value.  As wasnoted above, TIMEX3 tags that behave as temporal functions are oftenunderspecified in the example annotations below.<p>The values specified for the <tt>value</tt>attribute---<tt>duration</tt>, <tt>dateTime</tt>, <tt>time</tt>,<tt>date</tt>, <tt>gYearMonth</tt>, <tt>gYear</tt>, <tt>gMonthDay</tt>,<tt>gDay</tt>, and <tt>gMonth</tt>---are the XML time datatypes based onthe ISO 8601 standard.  See <ahref="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/</a>for the definitions of these and the other built-in XML schemadatatypes.  Since the TIDES guidelines, which we follow in this area,extend the ISO 8601 values, we will need to extend these data types toinclude these additional values.<p><tt>mod</tt> is an optional attribute adopted from TIDES.  It is usedfor temporal modifiers that cannot be expressed either within<tt>value</tt> proper, or via links or temporal functions.  Someexamples:<pre>(1) no more than 60 days&lt;TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P60D" mod="EQUAL_OR_LESS"&gt;no more than 60 days&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;(2) the dawn of 2000&lt;TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" value="2000" mod="START"&gt;the dawn of 2000&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;(3) about three years ago&lt;TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION" value="P3Y" mod="APPROX"&gt;about three years&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid="s1"&gt;ago&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;</pre><p><tt>anchorTimeID</tt> is used to point to another TIMEX3 in the caseof expressions such as &#147;last week&#148;, which have a functionalinterpretation.  The value of <tt>anchorTimeID</tt> provides thereference point to which the functional interpretation applies.<p><tt>anchorEventID</tt> is similar in function, and is used to point toan EVENT to serve as a reference point.<h2>3.0 &lt;SIGNAL&gt;</h2><pre>attributes ::= sidsid ::= ID{sid ::= SignalIDSignalID ::= s&lt;integer&gt;}</pre><p>SIGNAL is used to annotate sections of text, typically function words,that indicate how temporal objects are to be related to each other.  Thematerial marked by SIGNAL constitutes several types of linguisticelements:<DL><DT>indicators of temporal relations<DD>such as temporal prepositions (e.g &#147;on&#148;,&#147;during&#148;) and other temporal connectives (e.g.&#147;when&#148;) and subordinators (e.g. &#147;if&#148;).  Thisfunctionality of the SIGNAL tag was introduced by Setzer (2001).<DT>polarity indicators<DD>such as &#147;not&#148;, &#147;no&#148;, &#147;none&#148;, etc.<DT>indicators of temporal quantification<DD>such as &#147;twice&#148;, &#147;three times&#148;, etc.</DL><h2>4.0 Links</h2><p>Link tags encode the various relations that exist between the temporalelements of a document.  The motivations for having multiple types oflinks are the following:<ol><li>To distinguish between event types and event instances, such asthose introduced by conjunction, quantification, or negation.<li>To adequately handle subordinating contexts involving modality andreported speech.</ol><h3>&lt;MAKEINSTANCE&gt; (formerly &lt;RLINK&gt;)</h3><p>MAKEINSTANCE is a realization link; it indicates different instances of a givenevent.  One can create as many instances as are motivated by the text. All relations indicated by the other links are stated over theseinstances.  Because of this, every EVENT introduces at least onecorresponding MAKEINSTANCE.<pre>attributes ::= eiid eventID [signalID] [cardinality]eiid ::= ID{eiid ::= EventInstanceIDEventInstanceID ::= ei&lt;integer&gt;}eventID ::= IDREF{eventID ::= EventID}signalID ::= IDREF{signalID ::= SignalID}cardinality ::= CDATA</pre><p>A MAKEINSTANCE can be considered to be a functional object that takes anEventID as its input and produces an EventInstanceID as its output.<p><tt>signalID</tt> indicates a SIGNAL that either motivates the existenceof the MAKEINSTANCE, or which indicates the value of the <tt>cardinality</tt>attribute (see annotation of &#147;John taught 20 minutes everyMonday&#148; below for an example of this).<p>The possible value of <tt>cardinality</tt> is given as CDATA, i.e. anyASCII text.  In reality, its values are most likely to range over theintegers, along with a limited number of quantificational elements suchas "EVERY", "MOST", etc.  It may be possible to create a moreconstraining datatype (e.g. &#147;Cardinality&#148;), based on the<tt>string</tt> datatype, which constrains it to a fixed set of wordtokens, and any sequence of digits, but we have not yet done this.<h3>&lt;TLINK&gt;</h3><p>TLINK is a temporal link.  It represents the relation between twotemporal elements.<pre>attributes ::= (eventInstanceID | timeID) [signalID] (relatedtoEvent | relatedtoTime) relType [magnitude]eventInstanceID ::= IDREF{eventInstanceID ::= EventInstanceID}timeID ::= IDREF{timeID ::= TimeID}signalID ::= IDREF{signalID ::= SignalID}relatedToEvent ::= IDREF{relatedToEvent ::= EventInstanceID}relatedToTime

'ENDED_BY'magnitude ::= IDREF{magnitude ::= TimeID}</pre><p>Note that the optional <tt>magnitude</tt> attribute ranges over the IDsof TIMEX3 expressions that represent the magnitude of the relation (e.g.&#147;5 minutes before&#148;, &#147;10 days after&#148;, etc.)<p>Examples:<p>(4) John taught 20 minutes every Monday.<pre>John&lt;EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE"

There are two cases of SLINK. <ol><li> Cases where an event instance subordinates an event type; these are cases where a verb takes a complement and subordinates the event referred to in this complement. In these cases, the subordinated event is an event type, i.e., subordinatedEvent. <li> Cases where a subordination is introduced by a modal or negation. In these cases, the subordinated event is an instance of an event type, i.e., subordinatedEventInstance. </ol><p>This link is between a matrix eventinstance and a subordinate event type (though in some cases, such asnegation, the subordinated element is an event instance).<!-- Only evidential or factive SLINKs (i.e. those that introduce or refer toimplicit events---such as &#147;reportedly&#148; or &#147;forget&#148;)carry the ambiguity introduced by the <tt>polarity</tt> attribute.  --><p>SLINK is also used to indicate (negative) polarity, via

In general, it would be useful to allow confidence values to beassigned to any tag, and, in fact, to any attribute of any tag.<p>A convenient way to do this would be to create a confidence tag, whichwould consume no input, and which would have the following attributes:<pre>attributes ::= tagType tagID [attributeName] confidenceValuetagType ::= CDATAtagID ::= IDREFattributeName ::= CDATAconfidenceValue ::= CDATA{confidenceValue ::= 0 &lt; x &lt; 1}</pre><p>where<dl><DT>tagType<DD>would range over the names of all the tags of TimeML<DT>tagID<DD>would range over the set of actual tag IDs within the currentdocument (XML type IDREF)<DT>attributeName<DD>would range over the names of all the attributes of all the tags of TimeML<DT>confidenceValue<DD>would range over the rationals (i.e. would have a floating pointvalue) between 0 and 1</DL><p>So, for example, given this annotation:<pre>(19) The TWA flight&lt;EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE"&gt;crashlanded&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;MAKEINSTANCE eiid="ei1" eventID="e1"/&gt;&lt;TLINK eventInstanceID="ei1" signalID="s1" relatedToTime="t2" relType="BEFORE" magnitude="t1"/&gt;on Easter Island&lt;TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION" value="P2W"&gt;two weeks&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid="s1"&gt;ago&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;....&lt;TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME" value="1999-12-20"&gt;12-20-1999&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;</pre><p>if we wanted to indicate that we were unsure that we had annotated&#147;two weeks&#148; correctly, we could add this annotation:<blockquote><pre>(19') &lt;CONFIDENCE tagType="TIMEX3" tagID="t1" confidenceValue="0.50"/&gt;</pre></blockquote><p>where the lack of the optional attribute, <tt>attributeName</tt>,indicates that the confidence applies to the whole tag.<p>On the other hand, if we wanted to indicate that we weren't sure if thetense of &#147crashlanded&#148; was really <tt>"PAST"</tt>, we could addthis annotation:<blockquote><pre>(19'') &lt;CONFIDENCE tagType="EVENT" tagID="e1" attributeName="TENSE" confidenceValue="0.75"/&gt;</pre></blockquote><p>Abstracting confidence measures as a separate tag frees the annotationfrom having to include a confidence value attribute in every tag andeliminates the problem of uncertainty over the exact attribute of a tagthe confidence value applies to.<p>Note: currently TLINKs, SLINKs, and ALINKs do not have IDs.  If we wantto apply confidence measures to links and/or their attributes, we willneed to give each link a unique ID under this proposal.<p>As for how confidence values should be assigned in manual annotation, wefeel that, in a large-scale annotation effort such as TIMEBANK, twoconditions should be satisfied:<ol><li>Fairly high inter-annotator agreement on the tag assignment in the text.<li>Ease of use and habitability of the tool from the annotator's perspective.</ol><p>Therefore, the annotation of a scalar value such as confidence shouldhave at least two features:<ul><li>The choice of confidence values should be as clearly defined aspossible to cover the options; this relates to the granularity andorders of magnitude as presented by Jerry Hobbs as well. This wouldsuggest a selection from a small set (e.g. low, mid, high; not_sure,sure, abolutely_sure). These could be interpreted or rescaled to a (0,1]range, if need be, for subsequent inference.<li>There should be a default value specified (at high (=1)) so that itis not necessary to annotate all links and attributes for them with aconfidence.</ul><p>The constraint on human annotators to a subset of the possible valuesshould be documented in the annotation guidelines and implemented in theannotation tool.  And it would probably be best if the annotation tooldid not present numbers but rather natural language descriptions such asthose suggested above, which would be represented in the underlyingannotation numerically.  For example, the annotator might pick&#147;moderately certain&#148;, which would enter the annotation as .5.<p>Moreover, for manual annotation, it does not seem that the 0 and 1values will be used/useful.  Presumably if the annotator doesn't trustan annotation at all s/he won't add it.  And, as was suggested above, 1,at least for manual annotation, should be the default or unmarked value,and so need not be noted, since it would bulk up the files considerably,even if it were used only on entire tags.<h3>&lt;TimeML&gt;</h3><p>Inasmuch as every well-formed XML document must have a single root node,we supply <tt>TimeML</tt> as this node.
