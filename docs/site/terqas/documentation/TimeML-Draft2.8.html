The group started with two majordesign goals: (1) to use the core of Andrea Setzer's annotationframework (Setzer, 2001), which was christened STAG (SheffieldTemporal Annotation Guidelines); and (2) to remain, as much aspossible, compliant with the TIDES TIMEX2 annotation effort (Ferro, etal, 2002). The full set of changes made from STAG and the TIDES TIMEX2guidelines is as follows.<ol><!-- <li>Incorporate most of STAG. --><!-- <li>Stay compliant (after study) with TIMEX2 guidelines. --><li>Introduce a <tt>LINK</tt> tag: an object that links events/timesto events/times but consumes no input text.<li>Introduce a <tt>STATE</tt> tag: annotate only states that are updated in the context of the narrative being tagged.<br>Any state persistent throughout the entire article would not be tagged as a state.<li>Enrich temporal relations: add immediately-after (<tt>IAFTER</tt>)and immediately-before (<tt>IBEFORE</tt>). <li>Introduce <tt>scale</tt> as a relation attribute: we need toconvert preexisting Timex data into the TimeML standard. <!-- <li>Modify the <tt>DOA</tt> tag to have a tid attribute. --><li>Introduce event identity (<tt>ID</tt>).<li>Add <tt>NONE</tt> as a value for the <tt>tense</tt> attribute.<!-- <li><tt>aspect</tt> is labeled as a signal but retains itsexisting values (<tt>NONE</tt>, <tt>PROGRESSIVE</tt>,<tt>PERFECTIVE</tt>). --><li>Add temporal functions for doing temporal math on expressions such as "last week".<br>Track this as an enrichment over the TIDES guidelines.<li>To distinguish the fact that the TIMEX tag in TimeML is differentfrom both Setzer's TIMEX tag and the TIMEX2 tag, rename it TIMEX3.<li>Introduce a DURATION tag, dinstinct from TIMEX3, for expressions such as "two months".<li>Replace Setzer's DOA (Date of Article) tag with TIMEX3, sinceeverything tagged DOA is a TIMEX3 expression.  To distinguish thisTIMEX3 expression from all others, wrap it with a special tag,DocCreationTime.</ol><p>The working group also discussed the following features, although inless detail.  None are currently features of TimeML.<ol><li>Possibly identify "Event Clusters" or "time frames" in adocument. For example, often the events and situations in a documentwill cluster around a pivot or central occurrence. Other pivots mightinclude the actual reporting event itself. Hence, there are differentlayers of event clusters. This would beuseful for grouping related events in a narrative, temporalsegmentation of the narrative, by reducing the number of temporalrelations that need to be annotated. Also, this may prove useful toexplore relative to the Text Segmented Closure algorithm beingdeveloped. <li>Brief discussion of negation and modality. One suggestion is touse a <tt>polarity</tt> attribute on negative propositional content: <ol><li>The plane did not crash.<li>No survivors were found.</ol><li>Enrich the Event Typology to improve temporal inference.<br>This is related to the next point.<li>Add hooks to the event ontology for event entailment operations.<li>Include event and time closure operations as part of TimeML.<li>It was suggested that the head verb should not be annotated as an <tt>EVENT</tt> but rather as a signal to the event.<li>Along the same lines, it was also suggested that <tt>aspect</tt>should be annotated as a signal, rather than as an attribute of EVENT.<br>In combination with the preceding point, this would mean that the&lt;LINK&gt; tag (see below) would contain all the semanticinformation in the annotation.<li>Introduce init and cul attributes to events, or either reify init and cul as events, to handle aspectual events:<ol><li>The party will begin at noon.<li>The man began the lecture at noon.</ol></ol><p>In the remainder of the document, we outline a BNF for TimeML, as aninitial step towards specifying a complete XML schema for thelanguage, in addition to a DTD. The reason why an XML schema ispreferable to a DTD is that an XML schema provides an initial richerset of data types for constraining the value of attributes, and alsoprovides a mechanism for adding user-defined types.<p>In order to record the decisions that were made in creating TimeML, andto justify the areas in which it diverges from STAG and TIDES, thestructure of this documents recapitulates the changes that were made atthe various meetings of the TimeML working group and discussions withTIDES annotators.  Section 2 presents the additions that were madeduring the first meeting of the TimeML working group (March 11-15,2002); section 3 presents the additions that were made during the secondmeeting (April 22-26, 2002); and section 4 presents changes suggestedduring an "annotation fest" incorporating members of the TimeML workinggroup, corpus WG, and TIDES annotators (May 8 and May 15, 2002) in whichthe participants applied TimeML annotation to various texts, as a group.<h2>2.0 From STAG to TimeML---TimeML Phase 1</h2><h3>2.1 Tags and Attributes for STAG</h3><p>This section presents a BNF for STAG, the temporal annotation languagepresented in Andrea Setzer's thesis (Setzer, 2001).  Consideration ofthe details of this BNF, in conjunction with problems raised in tryingto apply it to actual texts, resulted in several changes andextensions to Setzer's original framework.  Detailing these issueswill help justify the details of this initial pass at TimeML.<p>A note on attribute values:<br>All attribute values are marked as 'potential values' in Setzer'sthesis; those marked with * may need to have a larger, but still closed,set specified.  Those not so marked may be sufficient as is.<h3>&lt;EVENT&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= eid class [argEvent] [tense] [aspect] [([signalID] relatedToEvent eventRelType) | ([signalID] relatedToTime timeRelType)]</pre>//* N.B. argEvent is dependent on class='PERCEPTION', 'REPORTING', or 'ASPECTUAL'<pre>eid ::= &lt;integer&gt;*class ::= 'OCCURRENCE' | 'PERCEPTION' | 'REPORTING' | 'ASPECTUAL'argEvent ::= &lt;integer&gt;tense ::= 'PAST' | 'PRESENT' | 'FUTURE'aspect ::= 'PROGRESSIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE'signalID ::= &lt;integer&gt;relatedToEvent ::= &lt;integer&gt;*eventRelType ::= 'BEFORE' | 'AFTER' | 'INCLUDES' | 'IS_INCLUDED' | 'SIMULTANEOUS'relatedToTime ::= &lt;integer&gt;*timeRelType ::= 'BEFORE' | 'AFTER' | 'INCLUDES' | 'IS_INCLUDED' | 'SIMULTANEOUS'</pre><h3>&lt;TIMEX&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= tid type calDate [(eid signalID relType)]</pre>//* calDate is limited to [[DD]MM]YYYY | ('SPR'|'SUM'|'AUT'|'WIN')YYYY<br>//* A standard SGML or XML DTD cannot represent this, but an XML schema can<pre>tid ::= &lt;integer&gt;*type ::= 'DATE' | 'TIME' | 'COMPLEX'calDate ::= PCDATAeid ::= &lt;integer&gt;signalID ::= &lt;integer&gt;*relType ::= 'BEFORE' | 'AFTER' | 'INCLUDES' | 'IS_INCLUDED' | 'SIMULTANEOUS'</pre><h3>&lt;SIGNAL&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= sid</pre><pre>sid ::= &lt;integer&gt;</pre><h3>&lt;DOA&gt;</h3><p>'DOA' stands for 'Date of article'.<p>No attributes<h3>2.2 Comments and Extensions</h3><p>One thing that is striking in looking at this BNF is this fragment ofthe attribute structure of EVENT:<pre>[([signalID] relatedToEvent eventRelType) | ([signalID] relatedToTime timeRelType)]</pre><p>In each case, we are dealing not with three unrelated attributes, butwith three attributes that only make sense as a unit.  The same triadalso appears in the attribute structure of TIMEX:<pre>[(eid signalID relType)]</pre><p>Moreover, as the specification of the values for the<tt>eventRelType</tt> and <tt>timeRelType</tt> attributes of EVENT andthe <tt>relType</tt> attribute of TIMEX indicates, we are reallydealing with one property, whose values are specified three times.This is forced in the case of <tt>eventRelType</tt> and<tt>timeRelType</tt> for EVENT by virtue of the fact that only thename of the attribute can link it to <tt>relatedToEvent</tt> or<tt>relatedToTime</tt>, respectively. And, of course, since<tt>relType</tt> is defined on TIMEX, not EVENT, it must repeat thespecification of permissible values.<p>All these considerations suggest that these triplets of attributesshould be factored out into the form of a new abstract tag (i.e. onewhich consumes no input text).  This would formally express the factthat these attributes are linked, allow <tt>eventRelType</tt>,<tt>timeRelType</tt> and <tt>relType</tt> to be collapsed into a singleattribute, and allow the specification of the possible values of thissingle attribute to be stated only once.<p>[Note: Of course in BNF (or in an XML DTD) it would be possible tospecify an abstract element as the value of <tt>eventRelType</tt>,<tt>timeRelType</tt>, and <tt>relType</tt> and thus state their possiblevalues only once, but we would still be left with the fact that theinherent relation between a signalID, relatedID, and relType would beunexpressed in the STAG annotation language.]<p>For these reasons, we remove the cited triplets from the definition ofEVENT and TIMEX and introduce the tag:<h3>&lt;LINK&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= (eventID | timeID) [signalID] (relatedToEvent | relatedToTime) relType</pre><pre>eventID ::= &lt;integer&gt;timeID ::= &lt;integer&gt;signalID ::= &lt;integer&gt;relatedToEvent ::= &lt;integer&gt;relatedToTime ::= &lt;integer&gt;*relType ::= 'BEFORE' | 'AFTER' | 'INCLUDES' | 'IS_INCLUDED' | 'SIMULTANEOUS'</pre><p><tt>eventID</tt> and <tt>timeID</tt> are used to anchor the link to anEVENT or TIMEX (the element that would have contained the [signalID](relatedToEvent | relatedToTime) relType triple before it was factoredout into LINK).  Note that factoring out this triplet also entails thatthe decision on where to record this information is now no longerarbitrary.  Previously, the information could be recorded on either oftwo related events, but there was no principle to decide which eventshould contain this information.<h3>2.2.1 Document Annotation in an Extension of STAG</h3><p>In addition to purely formal considerations of the geometry of STAG(essentially, refactoring considerations, in the sense of Fowler (1999)and many others), the TimeML working group also found empiricalconsiderations motivating addition of the LINK tag.  The original STAGframework had been designed with the presupposition that any given EVENTwould be related to at most one other EVENT or other indexed element.Attempts to annotate various newswire articles showed that thisassumption was false, and that a single EVENT could be related to morethan one other indexed element.  Here is one such example:<pre>FAMILIES SUE OVER AREOFLOT CRASH DEATHS   The Russian airline Aeroflot has been&lt;EVENT eid=1 relatedToTime=1 timeRelType=BEFORE tense=PRESENT aspect=PERFECTIVE class=OCCURRENCE&gt;hit&lt;/EVENT&gt;with a writ for loss and damages,&lt;EVENT eid=2 tense=NONE aspect=PERFECTIVE relatedToEvent=1 eventRelType=BEFORE class=OCCURRENCE&gt;filed&lt;/EVENT&gt;in Hong Kong by the families of seven passengers&lt;EVENT eid=3 tense=NONE aspect=PERFECTIVE relatedToEvent=2 eventRelType=BEFOREclass=OCCURRENCE relatedToEvent2=4 eventRel2Type=IS_INCLUDED signal2=1&gt;killed&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;in&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;an air&lt;EVENT eid=4 class=OCCURRENCE&gt;crash&lt;/EVENT&gt;.   All 75 people&lt;STATE stid=1 relatedToEvent=5 eventRelType=INCLUDES&gt;on board&lt;/STATE&gt;the Aeroflot Airbus&lt;EVENT eid=5 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE relatedToEvent=6 eventRelType=IAFTER signal=2&gt;died&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=2&gt;when&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;it&lt;EVENT eid=6 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE relatedToTime=2 timeRelType=IS_INCLUDED relatedToEvent=4 eventRelType=ID&gt;ploughed&lt;/EVENT&gt;into a Siberian mountain&lt;SIGNAL sid=3&gt;in&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;TIMEX tid=2 type=DATE calDate=031994&gt;March 1994&lt;/TIMEX&gt;....&lt;DOA tid=1&gt;03-27-96&lt;/DOA&gt;</pre><p>There are several notable features of this annotation.  First, noticethis &lt;EVENT&gt; element:<pre>&lt;EVENT eid=3 tense=NONE aspect=PERFECTIVE relatedToEvent=2 eventRelType=BEFOREclass=OCCURRENCE relatedToEvent2=4 eventRel2Type=IS_INCLUDED signal2=1&gt;killed&lt;/EVENT&gt;</pre><p>which features the addition of the ad hoc attributes<tt>relatedToEvent2</tt> and <tt>eventRel2Type</tt> as an attempt toallow multiple related events, along with the new attribute<tt>signal2</tt>, to link the signal to this related event and no other.Clearly this solution is fragile, in that it requires either a cut-offof related events at some arbitrary number or else an open-ended set oftriplets of the form:<pre>signal<i>N</i> relatedToEvent<i>N</i> and eventRel<i>N</i>Type</pre><p>Note that the LINK tag introduced above solves both the problem of thepotentially unbounded number of related events and that of relating aparticular signal to a given related EVENT (or other indexed element).<h3>2.2.2 Document Annotation with LINK</h3><p>Given the existence of the LINK tag, we can rewrite the above annotationas follows:<pre>FAMILIES SUE OVER AREOFLOT CRASH DEATHS   The Russian airline Aeroflot has been&lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=PRESENT aspect=PERFECTIVE class=OCCURRENCE&gt;hit&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=1 relatedToTime=1 relType=BEFORE/&gt;with a writ for loss and damages,&lt;EVENT eid=2 tense=NONE aspect=PERFECTIVE class=OCCURRENCE&gt;filed&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=2 relatedToEvent=1 relType=BEFORE/&gt;in Hong Kong by the families of seven passengers&lt;EVENT eid=3 tense=NONE aspect=PERFECTIVE class=OCCURRENCE&gt;killed&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=3 relatedToEvent=2 relType=BEFORE/&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=3 signalID=1 relatedToEvent=4 relType=IS_INCLUDED/&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;in&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;an air&lt;EVENT eid=4 class=OCCURRENCE&gt;crash&lt;/EVENT&gt;.   All 75 people&lt;STATE stid=1&gt;on board&lt;/STATE&gt;&lt;LINK stateID=1 relatedToEvent=5 relType=INCLUDES/&gt;the Aeroflot Airbus&lt;EVENT eid=5 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE&gt;died&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=5 signalID=2 relatedToEvent=6 relType=IAFTER/&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=2&gt;when&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;it&lt;EVENT eid=6 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE&gt;ploughed&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=6 relatedToTime=2 relType=IS_INCLUDED/&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=6 relatedToEvent=4 relType=ID/&gt;into a Siberian mountain&lt;SIGNAL sid=3&gt;in&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;TIMEX tid=2 type=DATE calDate=041994&gt;March 1994&lt;/TIMEX&gt;....&lt;DOA tid=1&gt;03-27-96&lt;/DOA&gt;</pre><p>In addition to the abstraction that LINK provides, there are severalother additions exhibited in the annotation presented above.<h3>2.3 Further Additions to STAG 1: Modifications to Existing Tags and Attributes</h3><h3>&lt;EVENT&gt;</h3><p>The <tt>tense</tt> attribute adds the value:<DL><DT><TT>'NONE'</TT><DD>for untensed verb forms, such as participles, etc.</DL><h3>&lt;DOA&gt;</h3><p>DOA previously had no attributes; it now adds the attribute<DL><DT>tid ::= &lt;integer&gt;<DD>which allows the DOA to serve as a temporal anchor for the entire article</DL><h3>&lt;LINK&gt;</h3><p>The <tt>relType</tt> attribute adds the values:<DL><DT><TT>'IAFTER'</TT><DD>immediately after<DT><TT>'IBEFORE'</TT><DD>immediately before<DT><TT>'ID'</TT><DD>identity (of events)</DL><h3>2.3 Further Additions to STAG 2: New Tags</h3><h3>&lt;STATE&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= stid</pre><pre>stid ::= &lt;integer&gt;</pre><p>The TimeML working group found that, in addition to annotating events,it is also useful to annotate a select subset of states.  We havedecided to recognize for markup only those states which are identifiablychanged over the course of the document being marked up. For example, inthe present document, in the expression <i>the Aeroflot Airbus</i> therelationship indicating that the Airbus is run and operated by Aeroflotis not a State in the desired sense. Rather, because it is persistentthroughout the event line of the document, we factor it out and it isnot marked up. On the other hand, properties that are known to changeduring the events represented/reported in an article will be marked asStates, as illustrated below:<pre>All 75 people&lt;STATE stid=1&gt;on board&lt;/STATE&gt;&lt;LINK stateID=1 relatedToEvent=5 relType=INCLUDES/&gt;the Aeroflot Airbus&lt;EVENT eid=5 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE&gt;died&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=5 signalID=2 relatedToEvent=6 relType=IAFTER/&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=2&gt;</pre><h3>2.4 A BNF for TimeML Phase 1</h3><!-- Tags and Attributes for TimeML Stage 1 --><p>Putting together all the modifications and additions discussed abovegives us the following BNF for a first pass at TimeML.<h3>&lt;EVENT&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= eid class [argEvent] [tense] [aspect]</pre>//* N.B. argEvent is dependent on class='REPORTING'<pre>eid ::= &lt;integer&gt;*class ::= 'OCCURRENCE' | 'PERCEPTION' | 'REPORTING' | 'ASPECTUAL'argEvent ::= &lt;integer&gt;tense ::= 'PAST' | 'PRESENT' | 'FUTURE' | 'NONE'aspect ::= 'PROGRESSIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE'</pre><h3>&lt;TIMEX&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= tid type calDate</pre>//* calDate is limited to [[DD]MM]YYYY | ('SPR'|'SUM'|'AUT'|'WIN')YYYY<br>//* A standard SGML or XML DTD cannot represent this, but an XML schema can<pre>tid ::= &lt;integer&gt;*type ::= 'DATE' | 'TIME' | 'COMPLEX'calDate ::= PCDATA</pre><h3>&lt;STATE&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= stid</pre><pre>stid ::= &lt;integer&gt;</pre><h3>&lt;SIGNAL&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= sid</pre><pre>sid ::= &lt;integer&gt;</pre><h3>&lt;DOA&gt;</h3><p>'DOA' stands for 'Date of article'.<pre>attributes ::= tid</pre><pre>tid ::= &lt;integer&gt;</pre><h3>&lt;LINK&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= (eventID | timeID | stateID) [signalID] (relatedToEvent | relatedToTime) relType</pre><pre>eventID ::= &lt;integer&gt;timeID ::= &lt;integer&gt;stateID ::= &lt;integer&gt;signalID ::= &lt;integer&gt;relatedToEvent ::= &lt;integer&gt;relatedToTime ::= &lt;integer&gt;*relType ::= 'BEFORE' | 'AFTER' | 'INCLUDES' | 'IS_INCLUDED' | 'SIMULTANEOUS' | 'IAFTER' | 'IBEFORE' | 'ID'</pre><h2>3.0 TimeML Phase 2</h2><p>Discussion of the initial version of TimeML, both by the TimeMLworking group and also in plenary sessions, revealed the need forfurther changes and additions.<h3>3.1 Eliminating &lt;DOA&gt;</h3><p>During presentations of the TimeML BNF of Section 2, representativesof TIDES pointed out that the text annotated with the DOA (Date ofArticle) tag was simply a TIMEX and so should be annotated as such.This led to a decision to eliminate the DOA tag and use TIMEX instead.In order to preserve the distinguished status of this temporalexpression as the primary temporal anchor of the article, it was alsodecided to wrap the TIMEX representing the date of the article with aspecial tag.  Since NewsML provides a number of timestamps, we decidedto borrow from its repository and use DocCreationTime (DCT) for this purpose.<p>There was discussion of using the Prism standard directly, namely  prism:publicationTime. <p>The following is excerpted from the Prism guidelines:<blockquote>There are several times that mark the major milestones in the life of anews resource: The time the story is published, the time it may bereleased (if not immediately), the time it is received by a customer,and the time that the story expires (if any). Dates and times should berepresented using the W3C-defined profile of ISO 8601[W3C-NOTE-datetime].</blockquote><pre>Table 4: Elements for Time and Date InformationElement                 Roleprism:creationTime      Date and time the identified resource was first created.prism:expirationTime    Date and time when the right to publish material expires.prism:modificationTime  Date and time the resource was last modified.prism:publicationTime   Date and time when the resource is released to the public.prism:releaseTime       Earliest date and time when the resource may be distributed.prism:receptionTime     Date and time when the resource was received on current system. </pre><p>Regarding the previous tag DOA and the new tag DocCreationTime (DCT),compare the annotations below. <p>Phase 1:<pre>&lt;DOA tid=1&gt;03-27-96&lt;/DOA&gt;</pre><p>Phase 2:<pre>&lt;DocCreationTime&gt;&lt;TIMEX tid=1 type=DATE calDate=03271996&gt;03-27-96&lt;/TIMEX&gt;&lt;/DocCreationTime&gt;</pre><h3>3.2 &lt;TIMEX3&gt;</h3><p>Since the exact nature of the tag TimeML uses to annotate temporalexpressions is different in detail both from the TIMEX tag in STAG andthe TIMEX2 tag in TIDES, we have decided to rename it TIMEX3.  While itis true that XML's namespace facility would permit a tag with the samename, but different usages, to exist in different namespaces (e.g.<tt>stag:timex</tt>, <tt>tides:timex</tt>, and <tt>timeML:timex</tt>),we feel that it is less confusing, as well as indicative of its origins,to name the TimeML variant TIMEX3.  Moreover, the <tt>calDate</tt>attribute of STAG's TIMEX was specified as having the value<pre>[[DD]MM]YYYY | ('SPR'|'SUM'|'AUT'|'WIN')YYYY</pre><p>while we wish to follow TIDES in using a modified version of the ISO8601 time standard.  We therefore replace the <tt>calDate</tt> attributewith <tt>value</tt> in our specification of TIMEX3, along with otherchanges we describe in this section.<h3>3.3 Additional Tags and Attributes 1: DURATION</h3><p>It was decided to add DURATION as a separate tag, distinct fromother TIMEX3 expressions. <h3>3.4 Additional Tags and Attributes 2: Temporal Functions</h3><p>One of the more complex constructions discussed by the TimeML workinggroup involved temporal expressions where the calendar date is notreferred to directly, but via an expression that acts as a temporalfunction over a TIMEX3 expression.  Examples include:<ol><li>last week<li>last Thursday<li>the week before last<li>next week</ol><p>Temporal expressions like the above might be annotated withinterpetations such as the following.  (We have used pre-theoretical,but fairly transparent, names to represent the hypothetical functions. DCT is the date of the article, presupposed for concreteness.)<dl><dt>last week = (predecessor (week DCT))<dd>That is, we start with a temporal anchor, in this case, the DCT,coerce it to a week, than find the week preceding it.<dt>last Thursday = (thursday (predecessor (week DCT))<dd>Similar to the preceding expression, except that we pick out the daynamed 'thursday' in the predecessor week.<dt>the week before last = (predecessor (predecessor (week DCT)))<dd>Also similar to the first expression, except that we go back two weeks.<dt>next week = (successor (week DCT))<dd>The dual of the first expression: we start with the same coercion,but go forward instead of back.</dl><p>Such representations present a problem for annotation because the neededfunctions, which would be best expressed as XML tags, can't appear asthe values of attributes in another XML tag. As always, the solution isto use a tag's ID as the value of an attribute, in place of the tagitself. Given this strategy, TimeML can define whatever functions arenecessary, and pass in the id of a function (tag) whenever we want touse it as the value of an attribute.  If we further allow the argumentsof functions to be function IDs, we can compose functions by using theirIDs as pointers (much as in the box and pointer notation for LISP). Toshow how this would work, we present the following sample annotations.For concreteness, we assume each appears in a document which has thefollowing DCT:<pre>&lt;DocCreationTime&gt;&lt;TIMEX tid=1 type=DATE value=1996-03-27&gt;03-27-96&lt;/TIMEX&gt;&lt;/DocCreationTime&gt;</pre><p>This tag's ID provides a temporal anchor in all the examples.<p>(1) last week<pre>&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;last&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;TIMEX3 tid=2 type=DATE valueFromFunction=tf2&gt;week&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;&lt;coerceTo tfid=tf1 argumentID=t1 scale=WEEK/&gt;&lt;predecessor tfid=tf2 signalID=1 argumentID=tf1 value=1/&gt;</pre><p>(2) last Thursday<pre>&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;last&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;TIMEX3 tid=2 type=DATE valueFromFunction=tf3&gt;Thursday&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;&lt;coerceTo tfid=tf1 argumentID=t1 scale=WEEK/&gt;&lt;predecessor tfid=tf2 signalID=1 argumentID=tf1 value=1/&gt;&lt;getNamedElementOf tfid=tf3 argumentID=tf2 value=THURSDAY/&gt;</pre><p>N.B.

This, of course, means extending LINKs to relating temporalfunctions, as well as assorted time expressions.  <p>Given the ability of LINKs to now relate temporal functions in terms ofLINK's full spectrum of relations, TimeML should have, in principle, allthe necessary expressive power for representing arbitrarily complextemporal expressions with arbitrarily complex relations.<p>Some notes on these sample representations:<ol><li>We have used pre-theoretical, relatively obvious names for thefunctions in the examples above.  We intend to use functions (tags)that, as closely as possible, follow the names of the temporal functionsin the ontology we adopt.  By doing this, our ontology would provide adenotational semantics for our XML-based temporal function markup.<li>Similarly, we have used relatively arbitrary and whitebread namesfor the attributes of the sample temporal functions (i.e. 'argumentID'and 'value').  We would want to give the attributes (i.e. arguments orparameters) of these function entities more meaningful names in thefinal version of this specification.<li>Since it would be unwieldy for our markup to recursively wrapSUCCESSOR (or PREDECESSOR) around itself, we have given SUCCESSOR (andPREDECESSOR) a second integer argument, which essentially encodes thenumber of calls to the function; i.e.<blockquote><pre>(SUCCESSOR foo 1) = (primSuccessor foo)(SUCCESSOR foo 2) = (primSuccessor (primSuccessor foo))...(SUCCESSOR foo n) = (primSuccessor_1 ... (primSuccessor_n foo) ...)</pre></blockquote><p>This is much like the INCF (increment-by) and DECF (decrement-by)functions in Common LISP, except that INCF and DECF allow their secondargument to not appear, in which case it defaults to 1.  For ourpurposes, we want the 'count' argument to always be present.<!-- Note, by the way, that this proposal means that we don't need togive IDs to the starting and ending points of EVENTs, TIMEXes, etc.  Wecan simply use the IDs of the endPointOf and startPointOf (or whateverwe call these functions) functions as values. --></ol><h3>3.5 Aspectual Verbs</h3><p>Relations expressed through predicates and nominal expressions aretypically anchored as deictic events.  The aspect expressed on the verb isa means of looking inside the event to focus on a segment orparticular part of an event.  For example,<ol><li> a. John built the house. <br>b. John has built the house. <br>c. John is building the house. <br>d. John had built the house.</ol><p>In languages such as English and French, there is an additionalgrammatical device of aspectual predication, which focuses on fourfacets of the event history:<ol><li> a. Initiation: <i>begin</i>, <i>start</i> <br>b. Termination: <i>stop</i>, <i>end</i> <br>c. Completion: <i>finish</i>, <i>complete</i> <br>d. Continuation: <i>continue</i>, <i>keep</i> <br></ol><p>Here, a member of a closed class of predicates is able to select averbal or nominal complement as an argument and mark that event withthe function (designation) associated with one of the facets above.<p>For TimeML, we will designate the class of aspectual predicates asevents of class ASPECTUAL. This class will have an additionalattribute which we will call PHASE. This attribute will take one ofthe four facets listed above. Finally, we will add the attributeARGEVENT to ASPECTUAL events as well.<h3>&lt;EVENT&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= eid class [argEvent] [tense] [aspect] [phase]</pre>//* N.B. argEvent is dependent on class='REPORTING','ASPECTUAL', or 'PERCEPTION'.<pre>eid ::= &lt;integer&gt;*class ::= 'OCCURRENCE' | 'PERCEPTION' | 'REPORTING' | 'ASPECTUAL'argEvent ::= &lt;integer&gt;tense ::= 'PAST' | 'PRESENT' | 'FUTURE' | 'NONE'aspect ::= 'PROGRESSIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE'phase ::= 'INITIATION' | 'COMPLETION' | 'TERMINATION' | 'CONTINUATION'</pre><p>To illustrate this mark up, consider a couple of example sentences.<ol><li> The boat began to sink quickly.<li> The search party stopped looking for the survivors.</ol><p>These two sentences are represented below in the markup defined above.<pre>The boat&lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE phase=INITIATIONargEvent=2 &gt;began&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;EVENT eid=2 tense=null aspect= null&gt;sink&lt;/EVENT&gt;.The search party&lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE phase=TERMINATION argEvent=2&gt;stopped&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;EVENT eid=2 tense=null aspect= PROGRESSIVE&gt;looking&lt;/EVENT&gt;.for the survivors.</pre><h3>3.6 Confidence Levels</h3><p>In various discussions of the full TERQAS groups, the utility of beingable to mark confidence values for various aspects of the annotation waspointed out.  In general, it would be useful to allow confidence values to beassigned to any tag, and, in fact, to any attribute of any tag.<p>A convenient way to do this would be to create a confidence tag, whichwould consume no input, and which would have the following attributes:<h3>&lt;CONFIDENCE&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= tagType tagID [attributeName] confidenceValue</pre><p>where<dl><DT>tagType<DD>would range over the names of all the tags of TimeML<DT>tagID<DD>would range over the set of actual tag IDs within the current document<DT>attributeName<DD>would range over the names of all the attributes of all the tags of TimeML<DT>confidenceValue<DD>would range over the rationals (i.e. would have a floating pointvalue) between 0 and 1</DL><p>So, for example, given this annotation:<pre>The TWA flight&lt;EVENT eid=1 class=OCCURRENCE tense=PAST aspect=NONE&gt;crashlanded&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=1 signalID=1 relatedToTime=1 relType=BEFORE durationID=1/&gt;on Easter Island&lt;DURATION did=1 value=2w&gt;two weeks&lt;/DURATION&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;ago&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;....&lt;DocCreationTime&gt;&lt;TIMEX tid=1 type=DATE calDate=12201999&gt;12-20-1999&lt;/TIMEX&gt;&lt;/DocCreationTime&gt;</pre><p>if we wanted to indicate that we were unsure that we had not annotatedDURATION correctly, we could add this annotation:<blockquote><pre>&lt;CONFIDENCE tagType=DURATION tagID=1 confidenceValue=0.50/&gt;</pre></blockquote><p>where the lack of the optional attribute, <tt>attributeName</tt>,indicates that the confidence applies to the whole tag.<p>On the other hand, if we wanted to indicate that we weren't sure if thetense of 'crashlanded' was really <tt>PAST</tt>, we could add thisannotation:<blockquote><pre>&lt;CONFIDENCE tagType=EVENT tagID=1 attributeName=tense confidenceValue=0.75/&gt;</pre></blockquote><p>Abstracting confidence measures as a separate tag frees the annotationfrom having to include a confidence value attribute in every tag andeliminates the problem of uncertainty over the exact attribute of a tagthe confidence value applies to.<p>Note: currently <tt>LINK</tt>s do not have IDs.  If we want to applyconfidence measures to LINKs and/or their attributes, we will need togive each LINK a unique ID under this proposal.<p>As for how confidence values should be assigned in manual annotation, wefeel that, in a large-scale annotation effort such as TIMEBANK, twoconditions should be satisfied:<ol><li>Fairly high inter-annotator agreement on the tag assignment in the text.<li>Ease of use and habitability of the tool from the annotator's perspective.</ol><p>Therefore, the annotation of a scalar value such as confidence shouldhave at least two features:<ul><li>The choice of confidence values should be as clearly defined aspossible to cover the options; this relates to the granularity andorders of magnitude as presented by Jerry Hobbs as well. This wouldsuggest a selection from a small set (e.g. low, mid, high; not_sure,sure, abolutely_sure). These could be interpreted or rescaled to a (0,1]range, if need be, for subsequent inference.<li>There should be a default value specified (at high (=1)) so that itis not necessary to annotate all links and attributes for them with aconfidence.</ul>The constraint on human annotators to a subset of the possible valuesshould be documented in the annotation guidelines and implemented in theannotation tool.  And it would probably be best if the annotation tooldid not present numbers but rather natural language descriptions such asthose suggested above, which would be represented in the underlyingannotation numerically.  For example, the annotator might pick"moderately certain", which would enter the annotation as .5.Moreover, for manual annotation, it does not seem that the 0 and 1values will be used/useful.  Presumably if the annotator doesn't trustan annotation at all s/he won't add it.  And, as was suggested above, 1,at least for manual annotation, should be the default or unmarked value,and so need not be noted, since it would bulk up the files considerably,even if it were used only on entire tags.<h3>3.7 &lt;SCALE&gt;</h3><p>The notion of scale was introduced, but we will defer discussion untilthe next version of this document.<p><h3>4.0 Further Modifications and Additions</h3><h3> 4.1 EVENT and ArgEvent</h3><p>As useful and intuitive as the phase attribute appears to be forevents, we will consider an alternative markup approach for thecurrent specification, motivated by concerns raised in an annotationworking group meeting.  Namely, we will remove the ArgEvent attribute from specific event types that have arguments, and introduce thisdependency through the LINK relation. This has the advantage ofallowing for multiple arguments to predicates (such as ``The shipbegan fall apart and sink'') without creating ad hoc compositeevents. <p>The event types affected by this change are listed below:<ol><li> <b>Aspectual verbs</b>: no args, rather introduces LINK, relationtype istaken from the PHASE values.<li> <b>Reporting verbs</b>:  no args, rather use LINK, where relationtype issomething taken from reporting value.<li>  <b>Belief verbs</b>: no args, use LINKS, where relationtype is from beliefrelations. <li> <b>Perception verbs</b>: no args, use LINK when necessary, mostprobably with relationtype INCLUDES. </ol><pre>The boat&lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE &gt;began&lt;/EVENT&gt; to&lt;EVENT eid=2 tense=null aspect= null&gt;sink&lt;/EVENT&gt;. &lt;link eventid=1 relatedtoEvent=2 relType=INITIATION&gt;</pre><p>Note also that  the domain of values for relType must either  beexpanded to include the values for the attribute PHASE, or we willhave to introduce PHASE as a value for LINK. We have chosen the formerfor now. <h3> 4.2 STATE</h3><p>From annotator input, we have decided to demote the status of STATEfrom an individual tag to a specific value for the CLASSattribute of the EVENT tag. The other attributes associated withevents will be potentially available to this class of predicates. <h3> 4.3. DURATION</h3><p>After significant annotator input, the decision was made to add DURATION as an additional  type of TIMEX3. The previous example making use of DURATION as a separate tag wouldnow be annotated as follows:<p>John taught for the 6 months ending March 31, 2001.<pre><!--John &lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE class=OCCURRENCE&gt;&gt;taught&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=1 signalID=1 relatedToTime=2 relType=COEXTENSIVE/&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;for&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;TIMEX3 tid=2 durationID=1 type=INTERVAL valueFromFunction=tf1&gt;the&lt;DURATION did=1 value=6 scale=MONTH&gt;6 months&lt;/DURATION&gt;&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=2&gt;ending&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;TIMEX3 tid=1 value=2001-03-31&gt;March 31, 2001&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;&lt;endPointEquals tfid=tf1 signalID=2 durationID=1 timeID=1/&gt; -->John&lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE class=OCCURRENCE&gt;taught&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=1 signalID=1 relatedToTime=2 relType=COEXTENSIVE/&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;for&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;TIMEX3 tid=2 durationID=1 type=INTERVAL valueFromFunction=tf1&gt;the&lt;DURATION did=1 value=6 scale=MONTH&gt;6 months&lt;/DURATION&gt;&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=2&gt;ending&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;TIMEX3 tid=1 value=2001-03-31&gt;March 31, 2001&lt;/TIMEX3&gt;&lt;endPoint tfid=tf1 signalID=2 durationID=1/&gt;&lt;LINK temporalFunctionID=tf1 relatedToTime=1 relType=IDENTITY/&gt;</pre><h3> 4.4 Aspectual Verbs Revisited</h3><p><pre>&lt;EVENT&gt;attributes ::= eid class [tense] [aspect]eid ::= &gt;integer&lt;*class ::= 'OCCURRENCE' | 'PERCEPTION' | 'REPORTING' | 'ASPECTUAL'argEvent ::= &lt;integer&gt;tense ::= 'PAST' | 'PRESENT' | 'FUTURE' | 'NONE'aspect ::= 'PROGRESSIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE'</pre><p>Add to relation types:<pre>relType ::= 'INITIATION' | 'COMPLETION' | 'TERMINATION' |'CONTINUATION'</pre><p>Use LINK tag to establish relation.

One proposal is to treat the"modifiers" such as "next", "last", and "N_&lt;time-unit&gt;_ago" assignals, relating to other times and events. For example, (1) would bemarked up as follows:<pre>&lt;DOA tid=1&gt;DDMMYYYY&lt;/DOA&gt;he&lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=PAST aspect=PERFECTIVE&gt;died&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;last&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=1 signalID=1 relatedToTime=2 relType=BEFORE magnitude=+1/&gt;&lt;TIMEX tid=2 type=DATE&gt;Monday&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.Sentence (2) would be represented as follows:&lt;DOA tid=1&gt;DDMMYYYY&lt;/DOA&gt;he&lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=FUTURE &gt;die&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;next&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=1 signalID=1 relatedToTime=2 relType=AFTER magnitude=+1/&gt;&lt;TIMEX tid=2 type=DATE&gt;month&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.</pre><p>It would also be possible to link the temporal function expression tothe DOA, but this would make it less explicit how the event predicateof "die" is bound to "last Monday". Furthermore, this would not beparallel to the derivation of "John died on Monday".<pre>&lt;DOA tid=1&gt;DDMMYYYY&lt;/DOA&gt;he&lt;EVENT eid=1 tense=PAST&gt;died&lt;/EVENT&gt;&lt;SIGNAL sid=1&gt;on&lt;/SIGNAL&gt;&lt;LINK eventID=1 signalID=1 relatedToTime=2 relType=IS_INCLUDED magnitude=0/&gt;&lt;TIMEX tid=2 type=DATE&gt;Monday&lt;/TIMEX&gt;.</pre><p>Notice that this particular proposal has added a new attribute to&lt;LINK&gt;, magnitude, which acts as a quantifier over theappropriate temporal granularity.  The granularity is dependent upon thetype and the caldate of the &lt;TIMEX&gt;.  Hence, if the value is"Monday", then the granularity for magnitude to operated over is aweek, and so on. This relates to the issues in the Ontology WorkingGroup as well as Hobbs' Semantic Web Temporal Spec Notes.  Hence, thenew specification for &lt;LINK&gt; is as follows:There are many cases of the temporal functions that were discussed bythe WG that will perhaps be handled in a slightly different way, ifthis is adopted.  For example, reference to events directly would bemore complex:<ol><li>He died the week before the party.<li>He died after the hijacking.</ol><p>In addition to the need for temporal functions of the sort sketched outto handle expressions beyond those handled by the TIMEX2 annotation,they are also useful for creating intensional descriptions of temporalexpressions. During the first meetings of the plenary group, it wasdiscovered that many temporal expressions are too indeterminate orfuzzy to be reduced to a concrete ISO time value.--><h3>4.5 &lt;LINK&gt;</h3><pre>attributes ::= (eventID | timeID) [signalID] (relatedToEvent               | relatedToTime) relType magnitudeeventID ::= &lt;integer&gt;timeID ::= &lt;integer&gt;signalID ::= &lt;integer&gt;relatedToEvent ::= &lt;integer&gt;relatedToTime ::= &lt;integer&gt;*relType ::= 'BEFORE' | 'AFTER' | 'INCLUDES' | 'IS_INCLUDED' |             'SIMULTANEOUS' | 'IAFTER' | 'IBEFORE' | 'ID' |	     'INITIATES' | 'CULMINATES' | 'TERMINATES' | 'CONTINUES'magnitude ::= &lt;integer&gt;</pre><h3>4.6 &lt;EVENT&gt; with POLARITY</h3><pre>attributes ::= eid class  [tense] [aspect] polarityeid ::= &lt;integer&gt;*class ::= 'OCCURRENCE' | 'PERCEPTION' | 'REPORTING' | 'ASPECTUAL' |           'INTENDING' | 'STATE'tense ::= 'PAST' | 'PRESENT' | 'FUTURE' | 'IRREALIS' | 'NONE'polarity ::= 'POSITIVE' | 'NEGATIVE'aspect ::= 'PROGRESSIVE' | 'PERFECTIVE'</pre><p><hr><h2>Bibliography</h2><p>Ferro, Lisa, Sundheim, Beth, and Gerber, Laurie (2002) <i>InstructionManual for the Annotation of Temporal Expressions</i>, MITREWashington C3 Center, McLean, Virginia.<p>Fowler, Martin (1999) <i>Refactoring: Improving the Design of ExistingCode</i>.
