The challenges derive from the combinedrequirements of a mapping process (text to a rich representation of temporal entities), representational framework (ontologically-grounded temporal graph),and reasoning capability (combining common-sense inference with temporal axioms).</p><p>Usually contextualized in question-answering applications (with obvious dependencies of answers on time), temporal awareness directly impactsnumerous areas of NLP and AI: text summarization over events and their participants; making inferences from events in a text; overlaying timelines ondocument collections; commonsense reasoning in narrative and story understanding.</p><p>Interest in temporal analysis and event-based reasoning has spawned anumber of important meetings, particularly as applied to IE and QA tasks (cf. atCOLING 2000; ACL 2001; LREC 2002; TERQAS 2002; TANGO 2003, Dagstuhl 2005).Significant progress has been made in these meetings, leading to developing astandard for a specification language for events and temporal expressions and theirorderings (TimeML). While recent research in the broader community (asindicated, for instance, in the most recent symposium on Annotating and Reasoningabout Time and Events) highlights TimeML's status as an interchange format, thisworkshop, however, is not intended to focus on TimeML exclusively. Likewise,while the ultimate goal of temporal analysis is to facilitate reasoning abouttime and events, the formal aspects of this problem are being addressed byother meetings (see, for instance, the TIME 2006 Symposium). Instead, the workshopwill explore largely the linguistic implications for temporal-analyticalframeworks.</p><p>The goal of the meeting, therefore, is to address issues alreadyraised, but not fully explored---including but not limited to the following:<ul><li>infrastructure questions: temporal annotation methodology, tools;reliable measures of inter-annotator agreement; community resources.</li><li>analytical frameworks: temporal information extraction; approachesto temporal expression normalization; relationship between namedentity recognition and temporal entities analysis; dependency (or not)upon syntactic and discourse structure.</li><li>mapping to time ontology(ies): completeness of the representationframework; formalization of the process; additional temporalreasoning capabilities required.</li><li>reasoning over time: in particular, (robust) reasoning withinrepresentational schemes demonstrably derivable with currentIE/analytical frameworks.</li><li>applications of temporal analytics and reasoning: in addition to NLtasks, of particular interest are studies of temporal information as itmanifests in, and impacts, different domains: beyond news, time isintrinsically essential in eg. legal, health-care, intelligence, financialcontexts.</li><li>national language: relationship between language characteristics andrepresentational frameworks; generalizations of temporal analyticsacross multiple languages; multi-/cross-lingual resource development.</ol></p><p align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p><p><hr width="50%"><a name="audience"></p><p><h4>Target Audience and Participants</h5></p><p>This workshop will be of interest to those creating or exploitingtemporally annotated corpora; those developing information extraction, questionanswering, and summarization systems relying on temporal and event orderinginformation; researchers involved in creating chronicles and timelines from textualdata (legal, health-care, intelligence); semantic web designers anddevelopers wanting to link web ontologies and standards to temporal markup fromnatural language; researchers interested in temporal properties of discourseand narrative structure; and those interested in annotation environmentsand development tools.</p><p align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p><p><hr width="50%"><a name="dates"></p><p><h4>Important Dates and Other Information</h4></p><p>Papers due: March 31, 2006.<br>Acceptance/rejection notification: April 29, 2006.<br>Final version due: May 20, 2006.<br>Conference: July 23, 2006.<br></p><p>For more details, refer to the <a href="http://www.acl2006.org">ACL-COLING 2006 website</a>.<p align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p></p><p><hr width="50%"><a name="committee"></p><p><h4>Program Committee</h4></p><p>David Ahn, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands<br>Nicholas Asher, University of Texas, Austin, TX USA<br>Paul Buitelaar, DFKI, Saarbruecken, Germany<br>Harry Bunt, Faculty of Arts, Tilburg University, The Netherlands<br>Corina Forascu, University of Iasi, Romania<br>Robert Gaizauskas, University of Sheffield, England<br>Jerry Hobbs, ISI/USC, Marina del Ray, CA USA<br>Graham Katz, University of Osnabrueck, Germany<br>Bernardo Magnini, ITC-IRST Trento, Italy<br>Inderjeet Mani, MITRE, Bedford, MA USA<br>Patricio Martinez-Barco, University of Alicante, Spain<br>Matteo Negri, ITC-IRST, Trento, Italy<br>Frank Schilder, Thomson Legal and Regulatory Co., Eagan, MN USA<br>Andrea Setzer, University of Sheffield, England<br>Marc Verhagen, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA USA<br></p><p align="right"><a href="#top">Top</a></p></tr></td></table></body></html>
