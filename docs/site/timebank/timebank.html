TimeBank started        as an illustration and proof of concept of the TimeML specifications.        TimeBank        1.1 was created  in the early days of TimeML and follows the 1.1 version of the specifications.        The more recent   TimeBank 1.2 and the AQUAINT corpus were compiled        following the 1.2.1 specifications.The TempEval corpus was created for the SemEval -2007 workshop at the ACL in        Prague. It contains the same documents as TimeBank 1.2 but uses a simplified        set of temporal relations, grouped in three separate tasks. </p>      <p>Future plans are (i) to merge TimeBank 1.2 and the Aquaint TimeML corpus,        and (ii) to create a significantly larger TimeBank using by now widely        accepted corpus        creation standards like dual annotation and the 90% rule.</p>            <h3>TimeBank 1.2</h3>      <p>The TimeBank 1.2 Corpus contains 183 news articles that have been annotated        following the <a href="../publications/timeMLdocs/timeml_1.2.1.html">TimeML      1.2.1 specification</a>. TimeBank 1.2 is free and is distributed        by the <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T08">Linguistic          Data Consortium</a>. Read more about TimeBank 1.2 in the <a href="documentation-1.2.html">documentation</a>,          which is mostly identical to the<em> timebank.html</em> file included          in the LDC distribution, except  that <em>timebank.html</em>        has      no section on inter-annotator agreement. </p>      <h3>AQUAINT TimeML Corpus</h3>            <p>The AQUAINT  TimeBank contains 73 news report documents. It is very        similar in content to, and uses the same specifications        as, TimeBank 1.2. Version 1.0 is available for <a href="aquaint-timeml/aquaint_timeml_1.0.tar.gz">download</a>.</p>      <h3>TempEval Corpus</h3>      <p>This corpus, based on TimeBank 1.2, was created for the temporal relation        task at SemEval-2007. Here, we make available        the <a href="tempeval/tempeval_training.tar.gz">training</a> and <a href="tempeval/tempeval_test.tar.gz">test</a> data,        as well as the <a href="tempeval/tempeval_eval.tar.gz">evaluation</a>        data        (test data plus temporal relations filled in). For more information,        see the readme.html files in the downloads, the <a href="http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/index.shtml">SemEval</a> and        <a href="../../tempeval/index.html">TempEval</a> websites, and the TempEval        task paper (<a href="tempeval/W07-2014.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="tempeval/W07-2014.bib">bib</a>).        The source data are copyrighted by the various content holders and can        be used for academic purposes only.</p>      <h3>TimeBank 1.1</h3>      <p align="justify">           In the beginning there was TimeBank 1.1, the  old <a href="timebank-1.1.html">release    notes</a> are    still available and the data itself can be downloaded      from <a href="http://nrrc.mitre.org/NRRC/Docs_Data/MPQA_04/approval_time.htm">MITRE</a>.                <p align="justify"> </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
