Each article  can be viewed. All events, timexes and signals are displayed. The events, timexes  and signals    in the document    are clickable (as long as you have Javascipt enabled). Clicking one of those  tags leads you to an exhaustive list of occurrence for the instance. From the  article view, you can launch another window with all links for the article.  Click a  link  in that new window and see it highlighted in the article view.</li>  <li>View the list of <a href="displayTags.php?tagtype=event">events</a>. Events    can be sorted alphabetically or on frequency. For each event, all sentences    in which it occurs can be retrieved, and for each    occurrence    it is possible to see the wider    context (that is, the whole article, the events will be highlighted).</li>  <li>View the list of <a href="displayTags.php?tagtype=timex">timexes</a>. This    is similar to viewing the events</li>  <li>View the list of <a href="displayTags.php?tagtype=signal">signals</a>. This is similar to viewing the events.</li>  <li>Search for <a href="findAlinks.php">ALinks</a>, <a href="findSlinks.php">SLinks</a> or <a href="findTlinks.php">TLinks</a>.    Search parameters are relation type of link and the tokens of the two related    elements. Events can also be restricted for class, tense, and aspect values,    timexes can be restricted for type and value. The search will never return    more than 250 matches (scrolling result pages need to be added).</li>  <li>Query timebank in a few simple ways, there is some overlap here with the link search.</ol><!--<p>Questions?
