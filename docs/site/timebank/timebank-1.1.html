This release should also include a copy of the <a href="../publications/timeMLdocs/timeml_1.1.xsd">TimeML      schema version 1.1</a>.      </p>      <h3>Provenance</h3>       Some of the documents in TimeBank are from the DUC1 summarization evaluation      that NIST ran in 2001 (files whose names start with "AP", "LA" "SJMN",      and also of the "WSJ" files). The rest of the articles are from ACE corpora.      The file names that start with "ABC", "CNN", "PRI", "VOA", "ea", and "ed" are      broadcast news. Those that start with "APW" and "NYT" are newsire. All      of these are included in LDC catalogitem <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2003T11">LDC2003T11</a>.The other ACE corpus is WSJ. The documents are included in LDC catalogitem <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC99T42">LDC99T42</a>. A  number of TimeBank documents have been excluded from this release because they  were annotated by 'naive' annotators and the results were not judged tobe immediately usable.<h3>Areas Under Revision in the 1.1 Release</h3> These documents were annotated during the creation of the TimeML standardand the <a href="../tango/index.html">Tango</a> TimeML Graphical Organizer tool.They constitute both a test domain for development and a proof of concept. Assuch, they should be considered preliminary. The user should be advised thatefforts are under way to revise these documents. In particular, the followingaspects of the annotation are being reviewed:    <ul>      <li>incomplete temporal linking<br>        Temporal relations have been manually annotated        between selected event pairs or event/time pairs only. A temporal closure        algorithm will create links    between many more pairs of events/times.</li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>event classes<br>        Event classification is currently being improved based        on multiple annotations by different annotators. </li>    </ul>    <ul>      <li>annotation of tense/aspect<br>        Incomplete tense/aspect information is available        for many events. </li>    </ul>    <ul><li>incomplete subordinated linking<br>      Some conditional structures and purposive        clauses may not have	been annotated.	</li>    </ul>    <h3>Non-TimeML Markup</h3> The documents contain other kinds of xml markup, including document	format and structure information, named entity recognition, sentence boundary	information, and others. We have made no attempt to review thisinformation. </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
