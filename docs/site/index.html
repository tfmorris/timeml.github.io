It isdesigned to address four problems in event and temporal expressionmarkup:</p><ol><li>Time stamping of events (identifying an event and anchoring it in time);<li>Ordering events with respect to one another (lexical versus discourse properties of ordering);<li>Reasoning with contextually underspecified temporalexpressions (temporal functions such as 'last week' and 'twoweeks before');<li>Reasoning about the persistence of events (how longdoes an event or the outcome of an event last). </ol><p align="justify">TimeML has been developed    in the context of three AQUAINT workshops and projects. The 2002 <a href="terqas/index.html">TERQAS</a> workshop    set out to enhance natural language question answering systems to answer    temporally-based questions about  the events and entities in news  articles. The first version of TimeML was defined and the <a href="timebank/timebank.html">TimeBank</a> corpus  was created as an illustration. <a href="tango/index.html">TANGO</a> was a  follow-up workshop in which a graphical annotation tool was developed. Currently,  the <a href="tarsqi/index.html">TARSQI</a> project develops algorithms  that tag events and time expressions in NL texts and temporally  anchor and order the events.</p><p align="justify">In addition, TimeML has been discussed and promoted in:</p><ul>        <li><a href="http://www.timeml.org/acl2006time/" target="_blank">	  ARTE ACL Workshop</a><br>          Annotating and Reasoning about Time and Events (July 2006)        <li><a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/05151/" target="_blank">	  Dagstuhl Seminar</a><br>          Annotating, Extracting and Reasoning about Time and Events (April 2005)        <li><a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~jamesp/HLT/index.html" target="_blank">	  NAACL-HLT Tutorial</a><br>          Annotation of Temporal and Event Expressions (May 27, 2003)       <!--        <li><a href="http://www.logic.at/esslli03/giveabs.php?13" target="_blank">	  ESSLLI Course</a><br>          Practical application of temporal and event based reasoning (August 2003)-->        <li><a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~jamesp/arda/time/esslli.html" target="_blank">	  ESSLLI Course</a><br>          Practical application of temporal and event based reasoning (August 2003)      </ul>    </td>     </tr></table></body></html>
