Hi there,

While reading other stuff I came across a couple of references that can be useful for the work on TLinking. Since I will forget them soon (and I don't know who is going to work on that), I'm sending them to everybody in case one of you is interested in the topic.

-- Dowty, David (1986) 'The Effects of Aspectual Class on the Temporal Structure of Discourse: Semantics or Pragmatics?'. In: Linguistics and Philisophy, 9: 37-61.

-- Passoneau, Rebecca (1988) 'A computational Model of the Semantics of Tense and Aspect'. In: Computational Linguistics: Special Issue on Tense and Aspect. 14(2): 44-60.
