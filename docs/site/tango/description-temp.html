In the previous workshop we focused on two efforts,reflecting the major deliverables of that contract:<ol><li> TimeML: Definition and design of a Metadata Standard for Markup of   events, their temporal anchoring, and how they are related to each   other in News articles. <li>  TIMEBANK: Creation of a gold standard corpus of 300 articles marked   up for temporal expressions, events, and basic temporal relations,   based on the specification of TimeML.</ol>   <P align="justify">In addition to these major deliverables, several secondary milestoneswere achieved, including:<ol><li>Creation of Algorithms for recognizing:<ol><li> Temporal Expressions, <li>Event Expressions  <li> Times associated with Events  <li>Ordering of Events and Times</ol><li> Development of a Text Segmented Closure Algorithm<li>Creation of a Semi-graphical Annotation Tool </ol><P align="justify">It is the last two of these deliverables above that will form thebasis of the present proposal for a graphical annotation toolkit. <P align="justify">The advantages of TimeML have already proven to be quite useful. Theseinclude: providing a robust markup framework for multiple domains andapplications; compliance and interoperability  with emerging Semantic Webstandards. Furthermore, its algorithms can be compared and measuredagainst common TimeML-marked up corpora, starting with TIMEBANK. <P align="justify">However, there are four major problems with annotating text to thisstandard with the currently available annotation tools, such as theAlembic WB. <ol><li> Inconsistencies: Annotators frequently input inconsistent   information.<li> Tag Density: (a) The annotation is very dense, mainly due to link   tags, (b) It is hard for annotators to keep track of relationships   mentally (see figure below describing the breakdown of elements in   a typical document). Notice that this number is only a fraction of   the possible temporal links in that document, which is in fact   quadratic to the number of events and time expressions.<li> Speed: The process is extremely slow, 1K/hour per annotator.<li>  Utility: (a) Research communities carrying out other tasks need to   adopt it, (b) Density and annotation speed is an obstacle.<li> Invalid Annotation: Since the current annotation tools were not   designed to produce XML, they occasionally produce invalid XML   documents. </ol><p>&nbsp; <h2> Workshop Goals</h2><p>The goals of the present workshop are to:<ol><li> Create a graphical annotation tool for dense annotation tasks (such asTimeML);<li> Embed an interactive closure algorithm into the annotationenvironment, which helps compute event and temporal relationshipsautomatically.</ol><P align="justify">Given that TimeML-style annotation is a useful (if not necessary)addition to any future efforts in question answering system design, wepropose to address the above challenges in the following way:<ol><li> Inconsistency: Graphical annotation with closure reveals   inconsistent mark up and catches errors. <li> Density: The new tool will move away from textual annotation for   links towards Graphical Annotation. Visualization is helpful in any   link analysis task and reduces the cognitive load of the   annotators. <li> Speed: We will use radical mixed-initiative architecture, involving   massive pre-processing and interactive post-processing  (including   temporal closure).<li> Relevance: This new effort should build links to other communities,   by showing value (e.g., Q&A, summarization, MT) with faster and   more accurate annotation. <li> Invalid Annotation: The new tool will be designed to XML-compliant,   so it will only produce well-formed XML. </ol><P align="justify">In this workshop, we propose to build a graphical annotation toolkit,called TANGO. The design and functionality of this toolkit willtake advantage of lessons learned during the TERQAS workshop, forwhich we developed a semi-graphical annotation tool, built by MarcVerhagen. This tool, called Event Diagram, is a first step towards afully editable timeline annotation tool. It is a semi-graphicalannotation tool that displays spatially how a selected event istemporally related to all other events and time expressions in atext. Adding links with this tool proved to be simpler andapproximately twice as fast as in Alembic. It was also much easier tochange focus and follow a chain of links. In addition, it was possibleto zoom in on one segment of a text, ignoring all events and timeexpressions outside the segment. Event Diagram is an improvement overAlembic-style annotation, but it does not fully solve the problemsstated above. <P align="justify">The general features of the proposed toolkit, TANGO, are:a. Graph visualization of temporal and event orderings;b. Simultaneous Display of Document Text and Graphical Timeline;c. Standard graph viewing controls;d. Close coupling with Temporal Closure Algorithm.e. Native XML output. <P align="justify">The tool has two main widgets representing the text and thetimeline. The text widget displays the running text of thedocument. It highlights temporal entities, events and other relevanttags in the input (signals, states). It should be possible to directlyannotate TimeML into the text. It should also be possible to selectevents or time expressions and drop them on the timeline.The timeline widget displays: (i) a scrollable time line with speechtime at the bottom, (ii) objects representing events and temporalentities, (iii) object attributes, and (iv) links. Links are displayedas directed arcs between objects, the arcs have attributes (relType,signals, etc.). Anchors are displayed as vertical lines from theobject to the timeline.<P align="justify">Elements in the timeline that are isomorphic to elements in the textwidget always point to the same object (if you edit one, the other isupdated automatically). Horizontally adjacent objects indicate theTimeML relations ibefore (immediately before) and iafter (immediatelyafter). Stacked objects indicate identity. Temporal inclusion ofobjects is indicated either by printing one object inside the other orby lining up the objects in columns.In the timeline widget, the user will be able to:- select objects and edit attributes,- drag objects,- select arcs and edit attributes,- create arcs between objects,- anchor objects,- delete objects or arcs.<P align="justify">The final feature of the annotation toolkit, the Interactive ClosureAlgorithm, helps increase the coverage of TimeML link creation for theannotation task. We will employ a user-assisted text-segmented closurealgorithm that was developed in the context of the TERQAS workshop(cf. www.time2002.org). This algorithm is an improvement over acomplete-pairing closure algorithm, where an annotator is prompted tofill in all the missing relations, an interaction which is notrealistic for large documents with tens of thousands of relations. Thetext-segmented closure algorithm does not aim for a globally completeannotation, but rather for a locally complete annotation. A locallycomplete temporal annotation of a document is defined as an annotationwhere each events is linked to all events and time expressions withinits local context and where each time expressions is linked to allevents within its local context. This relaxed completeness does notrequire the annotator to fill in all the relations that the closurealgorithm cannot derive axiomatically. User prompting is now linear tothe number of events instead of quadratic.<P align="justify">The closure algorithm will be embedded directly in the annotationtoolkit. Each time an annotator adds a link (or a link is generatedotherwise), the text-segmented closure engine compares that link toall existing links and checks whether one of the temporal axiomsapply. If an axiom applies, a new link will be added automatically. <h2> 3.0 Group Composition</h2> <P align="justify">The members of the team have been selected for their theoretical andapplied experience in information extraction, question-answeringsystems, and research on temporal and event reasoning. The Team Lead,James Pustejovsky, was PI for the TERQAS workshop, funded by ARDA in2002. Several of the current participants were involved in TERQAS,specifically in interface design and annotation tool development. <P align="justify">The following individuals will be the members of the workshop team:James Pustejovsky Brandeis University (Team Lead)Inderjeet Mani MITRE Virginia (Co-Team Lead)Robert Gaizauskas, University of SheffieldMarc VerhagenBrandeis UniversityLinda van Guilder, MITRE VirginiaDavid Day, MITRE<h2> 4.0 Project model and schedule/timeline</h2><P align="justify">The 3-week workshop will be held primarily in June 2003. There will bea short planning and kick-off meeting in March 2003. The proposedschedule is given below:April: 3 day Kick-off and Planning MeetingJune: 3 week meeting<P align="justify">Design and specification of the annotation toolkit will be begunduring the Kick-off meeting. Specification will continue during thelate spring leading up to the June meeting. This technique worked wellin TERQAS and I believe can be repeated here to great effect. The Junemeeting will focus on implementation of the toolkit. <h2> 5.0  Workshop Deliverables</h2><P align="justify">The workshop will generate a new toolkit for the annotation of textcontaining high dependency markup. In particular, the GraphicalAnnotation Toolkit will enable the quick construction of new goldstandard texts, overcoming the problems and shortcomings described insection 1 above. Deliverables:1. TANGO Annotation Toolkit: source code and executables,   annotation environment, user manual;2. Embedded Temporal Closure Algorithm; as a component of TANGO:   source code and executables.<h2> 6.0 References and Useful Prior Art</h2>Filatova, E. and E.
